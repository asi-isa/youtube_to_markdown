our next micronutrient is magnesium oh my goodness could I go on and on and on about the physiological benefits of magnesium it is involved in well over 600 reactions in your body from cell signaling vascular function ATP production protein synthesis uh neuroplasticity learning memory and I could basically think of anything that happens in your body and magnesium Central to that I don&amp;#39;t have to draw this out then it&amp;#39;s pretty easy for you to assume as is going to be a important role in your brain pre and post injury we also have very strong data if you are deficient in magnesium you have associations with a host of comorbidities health conditions type two diabetes metabolic syndrome hypertension headaches is another common one migraines heart disease so on and so forth we know that it probably inhibits receptors that are directly targets of anti-depressants as well and as a strong contributor to that brain excitotoxicity after injury so you do not want to be deficient in magnesium you can listen to read almost anything in the sports performance realm and you will see magnesium as a top tier supplementation it is really robust and a a strong line of evidence and and recommended by again many people in this field but surprisingly the S soe only three here there&amp;#39;s a well documented drop in magnesium especially near Central neurons after TBI and the extent of that drop is associated with the severity of the injury and the level of Behavioral disturbances so not only the injury but your symptoms as well animal and human research here from the animals It&amp;#39;s associated with edema brain and blood concentrations calcium problems like we talked about earlier um these are going to result in those behavioral modifications memory cognitive function spatial and working memory and so on and so forth from the actual human stuff couple of studies that are worth drawing attention to here one looked at acute tbis in kids and saw a significant reduction in postconcussion severity scores 48 hours after the injury when they used 400 mg of magnesium twice per day now another study was used a similar design and didn&amp;#39;t find a benefit but this was actually using magnesium from an IV for 5 days now no really actually knows why this one trial worked the other one didn&amp;#39;t the obvious thought is maybe there&amp;#39;s something that happens when you adjust it through your stomach that aids in digestion or makes it more bioavailable but when you took with the IV it didn&amp;#39;t to me that&amp;#39;s honestly not a great answer but I don&amp;#39;t have any other reason to think that that happened so really honestly to summarize here it is very very safe it&amp;#39;s very little harm it has so many other health and performance related benefits there&amp;#39;s so many Health consequences that are associated with magnesium deficiency it helps with symptoms and behaviors that are Hallmarks of TBI like we&amp;#39;ve talked about so I know the soe is technically three but personally it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s about as high in the list as I could think one supplement could be the dosages we described one more time 400 milligrams per day the timing doesn&amp;#39;t matter you&amp;#39;ll want to have some in their pre as well as post injury and you could take it at any point in the day now depending on the type or form that you use you might want to take it later in the evening some people report and depending on the type magnesium helps you fall asleep I personally feel no effect at all but most people do I still then take my magnesium at night just because just in case there is all kinds of forms you&amp;#39;ve heard of magnesium 38 at this point bisglycinate malate and right now I don&amp;#39;t know of any compelling evidence to suggest one of those forms is any better than another obviously magnesium 38 has become more popular recently and that may turn out to be more effective it may not I&amp;#39;m not sure there&amp;#39;s just not enough data for us to have a really an answer at this point and so you can take whatever form sits best with you the obvious risks associated with magnesium are the GI distress bisglycinate malate 3 and8 are generally pretty well handled and so you you shouldn&amp;#39;t have too many issues with it if you want to get it strictly from food you&amp;#39;re looking now at things like pumpkin seeds chia seeds almonds and spinach uh typically I think pumpkin seeds are about the highest you&amp;#39;ll find they&amp;#39;ve got around 200 milligrams of magnesium per 100 grams roasted again you can do some math there and realize all right that&amp;#39;s at least 200 grams of roasted pumpkin seeds I&amp;#39;d have to get to get to my you know 400 milligrams which is honestly quite a lot not impossible some people eat tons of almonds and spinach and things like that especially vegetarians and vegans but it is quite a bit given how cheap effective and easy to handle and how many other things are benefited with magnesium as a supplement n we use it pretty commonly if you enjoyed this clip you can watch the full episode by
