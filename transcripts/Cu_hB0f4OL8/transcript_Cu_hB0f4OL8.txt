if I wanted to develop an exercise program that was specifically targeted with the primary objective of keeping my brain as healthy as long as possible not necessarily my body composition or muscle or strength or anything like that um I wanted to do an exercise program for that one could theoretically say Okay lift weights a couple of days a week in exactly what you mentioned you know five to eight exercises whole body couple sets each yeah that&amp;#39;d be two days a week one day a week do something that is closer let&amp;#39;s just even say the Norwegian 4x4 that&amp;#39;s a great option yeah four minutes of the highest amount of work people get mad when you describe this as four minutes of Max effort are all out you can&amp;#39;t go all out for four minutes but the highest amount of work you can do for four minutes rest for four minutes and do it again I don&amp;#39;t really think friends like I cannot imagine a world in which that specificity matters yeah you don&amp;#39;t have to do the for you could probably do just about any type yeah of high-intensity endurance conditioning work and it would probably be the same but let&amp;#39;s just say for Simplicity you did 4x4 once or twice a week was that those interventions I think they were doing it three times a week okay but if you&amp;#39;re doing other aerobic exercise and and resistance training I think you&amp;#39;re gonna yeah you probably not going to need to do like a 4x4 three times a week that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty damn hard especially for six months of time yeah I&amp;#39;m going to say realistically as an exercise scientist I&amp;#39;ll give you permission to cut that to two yeah per week yeah and then maybe one to two or three sessions a week of the more lower intensity standard endurance exercise cardio whether this is even physical activity walking yeah uh or would they actually need to do more like 50 60% heart rate for that kind of cardiovascular adaptation so you know this is the this is the the age-old question is like it like what&amp;#39;s the exact intensity required to see a specific adaptation I think that and it&amp;#39;s the same uh we did a we did a podcast talking about the 4x4 on my podcast and um then somebody was like well what if I can&amp;#39;t maintain my heart rate in that zone for that long like just do yeah right do whatever you can for four minutes and you right you&amp;#39;ll get better over time and so I think it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s the same thing yeah like if it&amp;#39;s a if it&amp;#39;s a casual stroll you&amp;#39;re probably not getting um an adaptation but you know equally if if a brisk walk is hard work for you right then that&amp;#39;s going to be that that that&amp;#39;s going to be a good good place to be yeah this one RS me up so much because I I get it people want like specifically numbers but I&amp;#39;m so resistant to do that because it doesn&amp;#39;t actually matter usually yeah it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a rough concept of where you&amp;#39;re at so if those numbers help you great but something like that um here&amp;#39;s the reality don&amp;#39;t think that your brain all of a sudden won&amp;#39;t adapt yeah if you do half that yeah yeah if you did one day of lifting one day of intervals and a couple of days of walking it&amp;#39;s better than the zero yeah it&amp;#39;s a lot better right so you don&amp;#39;t have to hit that minimum number to get any effect whatsoever right probably getting closer to that Final Destination but if that takes you 6 months or 6 years to get to where you can handle that that being that little three you know protocol we talked about it&amp;#39;s fine yeah like get there eventually and and you&amp;#39;ll probably get um much to the benefit which which is great this actually answers a big question that I have dealt with a lot uh you and I actually have a a paper together again that you led where we found physical strength predict did I think it was 5% yeah of cognitive function right and I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll say that again like physical strength predicted 5% of cognitive function I have talked about people have talked about at length how leg strength how grip strength grip strength fires people up right and the common claim here is like a grip strength is just a proxy for overall health yeah and certainly true mhm um if you look at research on folks that have dementia you will see I think actually one paper found I can&amp;#39;t even think it was UK biobank paper about a half a million people in it found that I think 30% of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s death was explained by low grips rate yeah right not a small number and there&amp;#39;s a recent study showing that Frailty proed like precedes like Alzheimer by by several years on average multiple years I imagine right and and right if you&amp;#39;re frail you&amp;#39;re not doing all the things that we know continue to stimulate or support brain function right so what I want you to kill and perhaps this is the fifth thing that&amp;#39;ll irritate the internet that we&amp;#39;re going to call is the idea that this stuff the grip strength leg strength is exclusively an indirect or a correlation right of course there&amp;#39;s some yeah folks who are struggling with dementia are probably also then going to struggle with movement and there&amp;#39;ll be a backwards direction right there there would be a causation but it would kind of be backwards yeah causation right so and this horrible idea that strength is only a correlation to brain health and you just actually kind of answered the question before which is like how is it actually causal but then spell this out as directly as possible so I can cut this clip and send it to people every damn time I get told it&amp;#39;s just a correlation technically people are right a lot of this comes from epidemiological research correlation isn&amp;#39;t causation um however there are several studies we just talked about some where you randomize somebody to a resistance training intervention there&amp;#39;s strength improves brain function improves right brain structure improves and actually related to the point that you making in that in one of those studies yes you see sustained improvements in white matter structure with two sessions a week but you got improvements in cognitive function with just one session a week right so you don&amp;#39;t there these effects particularly if people aren&amp;#39;t doing much exercise are essentially linear and like so I if you could ask for a more causal function and structure benefit and in a dose response yeah so what else do we ESS says it&amp;#39;s causal right yeah and people are so depending on the type of research of course people are right you you can&amp;#39;t tell you can&amp;#39;t tell causation however what people also don&amp;#39;t necessarily understand is that in a perfect epidemiological study if you could account for every confounder and you know mediating and moderating relationships what you have left is causation that is like by that is a definition of causation so yes epidemiological studies technically don&amp;#39;t show causation but if you could it&amp;#39;s difficult because you don&amp;#39;t always get the variables you want right you can determine causation from an epidemiological study that is possible that&amp;#39;s allowed in you know a frequentist model of Statistics I&amp;#39;ll count that as like 4.5 thing that internet&amp;#39;s going to get mad at yeah you don&amp;#39;t think people understand basic statistics with that so um right people have worse physical health right we know so in the study that we did if you had higher uh blood blood sugar high hb1 C you had lower strength but I think that&amp;#39;s also B directional right you know more insulin resistance that&amp;#39;s going to worsen um muscular function but um if we think about the potential mechanisms by which this happens you have uh if you&amp;#39;re doing things that improve strength that&amp;#39;s a direct neuromuscular stimulus we&amp;#39;ve already talked about the importance of stimulus the next important thing is that your skeletal muscle is your biggest and most important GL glucose sink so if we&amp;#39;re thinking about the importance of energy regulation then your muscle like the more muscle you have and the more you move it the greater amount of glucose you can move through that system and this I mean this has been done for decades and decades and decades so your your skeletal muscle and your physical activity are two of the best ways to improve glucose handling and energetic handling more broadly and then the final piece is that when you contract your muscles you release a whole bunch of stuff right your muscles are organs so lactate bdnf m c irin Lac Fe like pick your metabolite cines spectrin like whatever like whatever it is like pick your favorite metaboli dour right um we&amp;#39;re still discovering like torine we&amp;#39;re still discovering on a like on a weekly basis the things that are released during exercise that have broad broad benefits so like all of that comes together to suggest that um yes it&amp;#39;s a bidirectional relationship but by improving muscular size and strength and function and those usually go together but not always depending on you know who you are um that&amp;#39;s there was four or five if not more different mechanisms that would directly Rel relate to improvements in cognitive function and brain health if you enjoyed this
