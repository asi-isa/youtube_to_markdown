how does a concussion actually work to zoom out for a second I think one of the reasons why we have really failed to produce consistent therapies or reproducible therapies for concussions is because we don&amp;#39;t study them properly and we don&amp;#39;t stud them properly because we don&amp;#39;t understand them properly hard to fix when you can&amp;#39;t Define exactly and so what is normally done or when people think about a concussion and if you read papers you&amp;#39;ll still see this um consistently experts in the field talking about it you you&amp;#39;ll hear something like the slush effect um or you know you imagine a head getting bashed and then like the brain banging around inside the skull like hitting one side of hitting one side of the skull then banging and hitting the other side that&amp;#39;s what they call a contra injury which is basically you see some injury on the opposite side from from where the impact occurred the brain is you know it&amp;#39;s mainly fat and water and it is then surrounded by fluid and it&amp;#39;s inside uh Solid box and that fluid is full of salt that fluid is full of salt if you take a solid box full of water even if it&amp;#39;s got something very fragile inside and you shake it really hard that fragile thing does not bang against the sides because the water is Right buffers it or the you know the CSF the fluid I saw you do this it was the one of the coolest things I&amp;#39;ve ever seen you took an egg and you put it in a jar with salt water I don&amp;#39;t remember the concentration you put it in it was just like normal yeah normal sighting yeah and you you know screwed the top of a ball jar or whatever it was and you shook the living crap out of the egg and the yolk didn&amp;#39;t break yeah at all no cuz it&amp;#39;s not hitting anything no it&amp;#39;s smashed it stays right in the it stays right in the middle I in that moment I went I what like everything cuz I had said that always I did not know that until you showed me that yeah not me but you&amp;#39;re were showing other people and I was like wow so if if you could while I&amp;#39;m shaking it image the jar what you would see is you would see distortions um along the surface of the egg yolk inside inside this jar so there are distortions so the egg instead of being a perfect circle turns into an oval it&amp;#39;s not smashing against the wall it&amp;#39;s just being distorted and it&amp;#39;s being um accordioned exactly squished and and pulled back apart right so how we generally study can s is the other version of of the egg experiment which I also showed which is that you have your your egg yolk in your solution and you leave a big chunk of air in the top of the jar you shake that immediately it turns into salad dressing right immediately you dispers that egg yolk throughout the liquid that&amp;#39;s how we normally study concussion but what happens um if you then look at where injury is in people who&amp;#39;ve had concussions so like you look at individuals who have uh CTE right they probably have some ongoing history of concussions it&amp;#39;s happened multiple times if you look at where the injury has accumulated it&amp;#39;s not at the surface of of the brain it&amp;#39;s not the brain banging against the skull what&amp;#39;s happening is that these distortions like waves of energy that are transferred through the brain is are the interfaces of different parts of the brain so particularly the interfaces between the gray matter on the outside and the white matter underneath it&amp;#39;s connective tissue yeah they&amp;#39;re tearing the connective yeah so right at the usually right the the base of the sulai so you think about the brain is really wrinkly right those are the gy the the sort of the divots in between those wrinkles the sulai at the base of those that&amp;#39;s where you tend to see uh injury and it&amp;#39;s because you have uh tissues of different densities where then the Distortion travels at different rates so then you create this shearing effect at those interfaces and then that&amp;#39;s right and if the shearing effect is very large you can rip axons you so create direct direct axonal injury um if it&amp;#39;s a blast wave then obviously you&amp;#39;re not directly shearing anything but you still you still seem to injure those same areas because the energy wave is transferring through the brain at at different rates and so that&amp;#39;s where the injury accumulates is at TH at those interfaces so then how do things like creatine and lactate help do they work at all and if so how I&amp;#39;ve been uh really excited about the potential for lactate in traumatic brain injury and and that uh excitement aligns very similarly to with ketones um but people have been talking about them for a long time and I&amp;#39;m still waiting for some good some good human studies I&amp;#39;ve been probably talking about it for a decade online like in front of people on podcasts and things like that yeah so I I believe that they could be beneficial but we just haven&amp;#39;t seen really high quality evidence yet however now that&amp;#39;s clear we haven&amp;#39;t seen evidence that shows they don&amp;#39;t work either no the stud aren&amp;#39;t being done no no and if if I were to get a significant concussion or TBR like I&amp;#39;m going straight to the keton Esters because I believe that there&amp;#39;s a high chance of benefit with low risk anybody who&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t have a randomized control trial to tell you that that&amp;#39;s the case but you know I think it could if it was my brain that&amp;#39;s what I would do as an mdphd in brain health this is what you would do infer that for what you will folks uh part of it is that it&amp;#39;s essentially providing some kind of metabolic substrate in an area of the brain where there is impaired metabolism so one of the consistent responses you see to an accute brain injury and again Strokes cardiac arrests traumatic brain injuries is what we call Energy failure so there&amp;#39;s this uh gap between energy requirements and energy Supply because you have dysfunctional mitochondria ketones and lactate can kind of bypass some of that and seem to be um less uh less energy energetically expensive or they&amp;#39;re more energetically efficient in terms of generating ATP like the effect is small but in that kind of setting a small effect uh may you know may be enough to help to help minimize injury there&amp;#39;s also going to be some other signaling effects that that could that could be beneficial um like both lactate and ketones have a whole range of other um anti-inflammatory um neurotrophic kind of effects so so lactates seems to help and ketones seem to help drive an increase in production in bdnf brain derive neurotrophic factor which could help uh recovery so beyond their effect on um your metabolism they may have these other Downstream uh effects as well but another reason why this is important is that in the acute uh injury setting the brain may become relatively uh insensitive to glucose or glucose uptake decreases so um but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the case because the the transport is different and both ketones and lactate go in through the monoc carboxilate Transporters which aren&amp;#39;t necessarily affected in that state so some of it could be that particularly ketones might be more um metabolically efficient in terms of energy production but also they&amp;#39;re may be more likely to get into the brain in the setting of of an acute injury to help support are they potentially less negatively influenced by inflammatory markers as well um yes potentially although I mean it kind of depends on what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on on how they&amp;#39;re getting in if you enjoyed this clip you can watch the full episode by clicking here
