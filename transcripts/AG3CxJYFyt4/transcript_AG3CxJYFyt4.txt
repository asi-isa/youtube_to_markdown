number eight on my list is getting good sleep now you don&amp;#39;t have to be perfect here but one of the things we know happens with really bad sleep even on a single day is people tend to seek out more total calories and it makes sense you&amp;#39;re tired you feel like you&amp;#39;re in a low energy State you&amp;#39;re going to want to get more energy that&amp;#39;s exactly what your body is doing and is a natural response this has been shown extensively in the literature under acute fatigue from lack of sleep people will search out more total calories and I&amp;#39;ll also search out food items that tend to be higher energy density you can think about these as junk Foods if you&amp;#39;d like I know personally I search after carbohydrates I don&amp;#39;t know why but I really want more bread I really not that the bread is bad for you but I really want carbohydrates when I&amp;#39;m fatigued again intuitively it actually makes a ton of sense this is the primary and fastest energy source for your body but that one hits me very directly so I know that&amp;#39;s something I have to watch out for and has been shown multiple times most people are like that and the physiology makes intuitive sense so if you&amp;#39;re wanting to then quote unquote speed up your metabolism ensuring you&amp;#39;re not in a spot repeatedly where sleep is bad therefore it&amp;#39;s not that your metabolic rate has changed but you&amp;#39;re going to make worse food choices and so your total energy intake is higher which means your intake versus energy out that balance is off which is is then going to lead to eventual body composition changes so there&amp;#39;s more to say on that but that&amp;#39;s if you&amp;#39;re a little bit confused on why that is on my list it&amp;#39;s not necessarily that sleep will enhance your metabolism but bad sleep can have a number of negative impacts and one of them being behavioral changes specifically with food and calorie intake one thing that will suppress acutely and chronically as we&amp;#39;ll talk about later your total daily energy expenditure and specifically RMR is really bad sleep neat specifically will go down in the presence of poor sleep acute and chronic the one night of bad sleep is probably not a big deal but magnifi over time will make a huge impact so your neat is going to go down your drive for Worse food choices and more food overall will increase energy expenditure might also go down you know it&amp;#39;s harder to work out you&amp;#39;re not going to take the walks you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re more likely to skip your training sessions or condense them or just get through it when you&amp;#39;ve had a bad night of sleep and you also are going to potentially see red reductions in resting metabolic rate and so for me personally what I do when I have a bad night of sleep and it happens I have kids and I travel and all kinds of things happen three things I do to mitigate this damage number one what I&amp;#39;ve already talked about I will double triple down as much as I can on protein basically I&amp;#39;m trying to crowd out other Foods so I know I just really want to go for Burgers and Fries and stuff like that and I know it&amp;#39;s cuz I slept for 3 hours night before I&amp;#39;m going to smash a double scoop of protein I&amp;#39;m just going to keep it really really really high I still might go get those foods but I just don&amp;#39;t have the physical space in my stomach anymore I get full of course occasionally I&amp;#39;m a person I&amp;#39;ll just go have the burgers and fries I&amp;#39;m not neurotic about it but if this stuff happens somewhat regularly you can&amp;#39;t always fall into that trap at some point you need to make sure you don&amp;#39;t do that willpower is one way but personally I just make sure I&amp;#39;m smashing protein throughout the day to reduce that risk second thing I do is I make sure I hit all that lowlevel energy expenditure stuff so maybe I don&amp;#39;t have it in me to do my interval training or my assault bike or run my Hills or whatever but I&amp;#39;ll make sure I walk let&amp;#39;s move around let&amp;#39;s get three or four of those 10-minute walks in no matter how tired and sleepy I am or sick for the most part you can probably get yourself to walk those couple hundred calories are going to add up especially again if this happens frequently uh sauna is another good one sauna is not a replacement for exercise but hey you can a lot of times convince yourself to take a hot bath or a sauna and get something out of the day third thing I do and this is going to stun people but take a nap go ahead and actually just sleep you could suffer all throughout the day making worse choices and skipping your workout or maybe that 30 60 or 90 minute nap while you&amp;#39;re going to feel like you&amp;#39;re not working that time because you&amp;#39;re not if it substantially enhances the quality of the next 10 hours of your day sneaking in a little bit of may change everything and is a good thing to do again when you magnify this stuff over time to the real shabam here and that&amp;#39;s resting metabolic ratee this is the one we&amp;#39;re after and the only one that really matters in terms of me officially saying yes we have boosted your metabolism in a way that you care about and will matter got a handful of ways to do that and the very first one is sleep we talked about this with a cute but the impacts of sleep are far better explained from The Chronic side enormous amounts of data here and much of it is very recent in fact we had very little understanding of the metabolic ties between sleep and Metabolism until the last really 10 years or so now the relationship between sleep and metabolism is bidirectional we talked about bad sleep changing metabolism a second ago but it goes the opposite direction as well a bunch of research I could pull up here but a couple of ones that I&amp;#39;ve found most interesting that I wanted to highlight one study in particular that came out of the University of Chicago a number of years ago looked at 10 overweight individuals and they put them on a 14-day caloric restriction protocol and one of the times they went through the protocol they slept eight and 1 half hours the other time they went through the protocol they slept 5 and 1 half hours so again University controlled calories in both situations the only variable that changed was three hours of sleep so now we&amp;#39;re not even talking about the impact of bad nutritional choices this is simply even if calories are matched what happens when you sleep more right now the Sleep curtailment group the sleep that the group that slept for five and a half hours had a reduction in fat loss by 55% in absolute terms you&amp;#39;re talking about the difference between like 1.4 kilos versus 6 kilos so almost a full kilogram difference in fat loss that favored the group who slept more the same thing basically happened in terms of muscle mass uh you can&amp;#39;t directly measure it in the study but it&amp;#39;s called fat-free body mass and just think of it like muscle mass and this was about a 60% difference so absolute terms you&amp;#39;re talking about 1.5 kilos versus 2.4 kilos so almost a full kilogram or about 2 lbs of lean muscle difference this is substantial remember this is 14 days that&amp;#39;s it and all they Chang was sleep and we see pronounced increases in fat and reduction in muscle growth with just this variable change right so what you can see there is additional stuff that they looked at actually fat oxidation um satiety I think as well was in there but really problematic uh things going on when you sleep poorly that relationship uh if I had to summarize the literature you&amp;#39;re going to see like a 10 to 60% increased likelihood of a obesity with bad sleep so there&amp;#39;s a chronic effect here that is very very real one more time it&amp;#39;s bidirectional so we see what I&amp;#39;m meaning there is if you are overweight you&amp;#39;re probably going to have worse sleep but worse sleep is actually going to cause overweight so the cause goes both directions there really nice paper came out pretty recently it&amp;#39;ll be up in the show notes you can check it out specifically on the relationship between obesity and sleep and how it goes both directions you can see those details and that but another thing that is that has been identified in the literature there is the direct relationship between muscle mass and sleep and it goes the way that you would predict not only does more fat often times equal worse sleep but more muscle oftentimes equals better sleep so two independent things happening there not enough muscle bad too much fat bad there&amp;#39;s a relationship as well there but they are separate and we need to acknowledge that so it&amp;#39;s not only important to make sure we&amp;#39;re we not overfat but that we have muscle as well this is actually an area that&amp;#39;s getting a lot of scientific attention right now that people don&amp;#39;t necessarily realize and that is normal weight obesity you heard that right normal weight obesity so people whose total body weight is not exceptionally high but their body fat percentage is really high probably not kindly put but you may know this more cloy as skinny fat the more proper term is again normal weight obesity but this is an area again scientifically that&amp;#39;s getting a lot of attention right now because of acknowledgement of things like that it&amp;#39;s not necessarily just about body weight but the quality of that body weight matters a ton more research on this chronic tie between resting metabolic rate and bad sleep very very famous study in the field called The Sleep heart health study um this was self-reported sleep folks that self-reported less than five hours of sleep per night had and this is going to stun you here this was associated with a 250 51% increase in their Hazard ratio of developing type 2 diabetes Now type two diabetes and obesity are not the same thing but obviously there&amp;#39;s a strong relationship there what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is just general metabolic dysfunction with bad sleep similar things have been done with impaired insulin signaling specifically in atpo cells those your fat cells in folks who sleep five and a half hours versus eight and a half hours so we&amp;#39;re seeing this in a lot of different forms and fashion in fact one of the papers and I&amp;#39;m going to quote it directly here because it&amp;#39;s so powerful uh specifically said that quote from a clinical standpoint our study provides additional evidence that insufficient sleep May contribute to the development of or exacerbate metabolic disorders I can tell you in my coaching experience it is really really hard to manage body composition and thus metabolic rate and somebody who is truly chronically sleeping really poorly it is tough you got to fix that sleep or at least improve it before you expect major changes in body composition one night of sleep not a big deal bad nights of sleep though you&amp;#39;re probably going to expect a reduced resting metabolic rate which is why it&amp;#39;s in our chronic section and a big big big
