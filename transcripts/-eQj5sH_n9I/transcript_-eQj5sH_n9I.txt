we have learned very recently a lot of information about what explains why some people can do things like eat more calories eat more food but yet not gain as much weight as you that is a real phenomenon even when all other variables are controlled for that can happen but that&amp;#39;s not explained by having a faster or slower metabolism so let&amp;#39;s imagine a scenario in which you consume and burn exactly 2,000 calories per day so you&amp;#39;re net equal and at that you keep the exact same level of muscle and energy and recovery and performance and body fat and so on and so forth if I could do that exact same thing at 4,000 calories now I&amp;#39;ve got much more options what I mean by that is if I can keep you at the exact same for all those variables at Double the caloric load I&amp;#39;ve got a greater ability to increase my food intake which means my micronutrients go up if I eat double the food I get double the vitamins and minerals and nutrients and fiber intake and if I&amp;#39;m staying at the exact same body composition body mass that is a huge Advantage additionally it now becomes far easier to lose weight if you ever want to do that one of the things that makes it really hard for weight loss if your metabolism is quote unquote slow again think that total input versus output is low say 2,000 and you want to drop it by say 500 calories you&amp;#39;ve reduced a significant portion of of your caloric intake you&amp;#39;re going to feel that and you&amp;#39;ve dropped a quarter of your calories however if you&amp;#39;re at 4,000 calories Turn and Burn and we drop you by 500 now we&amp;#39;ve only lowered your intake by a small percentage and so you don&amp;#39;t feel that much of a difference you won&amp;#39;t really feel 3500 calories versus 4,000 calories but you&amp;#39;ll feel 15 versus 2,000 even though in both cases is exactly 500 calories and so for a lot of people there is still a huge interest in understanding and making your overall metabolism function how you want for both the short and long term regardless of whether or not body composition or body fat is your primary secondary or even of slight interest to you right now now I can continue talking about that Delta and why you want to avoid energy toxicity but you do at the same time want to have a high caloric intake but we&amp;#39;ll save those thoughts for another conversation we want to get really into today&amp;#39;s topic and so what is speeding up your metabolis is M even mean and I&amp;#39;ve been using a bunch of different terms thus far on purpose I&amp;#39;ve tried to throw out misconceptions I&amp;#39;ve used the wrong phrase intentionally because that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s used colloquially that&amp;#39;s probably how you&amp;#39;ve heard it and that&amp;#39;s how you&amp;#39;ve thought about it so I&amp;#39;ve done that uh with direct intent there we&amp;#39;re going to talk about what those things mean we&amp;#39;re going to talk about what it actually means to have a fast or slow metabolism and so let&amp;#39;s get into those very basic parts right now scientifically metabolism is the net of all cellular processes in your entire body so when you&amp;#39;re metabolizing hormones or proteins or energy substrates like carbohydrates and fat all of that is combined together to make up your metabolism so that is a giant net it is not specifically and only referring to the calories in versus calories out what you&amp;#39;re burning for exercise or your body fat composition it is all things going on that is an incredibly difficult number to come up with it is not a rate it is a total amount what what I mean by that is it&amp;#39;s not a speed this is why I can tell you people in our field and mind you I&amp;#39;ve got a PhD in human bioenergetics so people in this field will tell you there is no speed component here it is a total rate component and so the analogy I&amp;#39;ll give you here is a car okay now if I had you driving in your car at 50 mil an hour and we increased you to 70 M hour your speed went up okay when people think about boosting their metabolism that&amp;#39;s what they think happens I&amp;#39;m driving faster and when we say you don&amp;#39;t speed up your metabolism when I tell you yours is the same speed as mine what I mean is we&amp;#39;re all driving at 50 miles hour but at the same time I also did tell you we can raise it and that there are some people who can handle more energy and not gain as much and so forth that&amp;#39;s not a speed issue what that is is the total amount of drive time right it is not speeding up your metabolism it is going through metabolism more frequently that&amp;#39;s effectively what&amp;#39;s happening so it&amp;#39;s driving more often if you drive more often let&amp;#39;s say again the analogy of speed here we&amp;#39;re both driving at 50 miles per hour you don&amp;#39;t speed up or slow down but I drive for one mile and you drive for 15 who burned more gas you did that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re talking about so somebody with a fast metabolism is someone who simply driving for 15 miles and someone with a slow metabolism is somebody who&amp;#39;s driving for 5 miles or 2 mil miles or whatever the case may be that is incredibly important because we as we start getting into claims in the field and misconceptions and improper marketing they&amp;#39;re going to use those things as tricks and ways to twist you so easy examples there&amp;#39;s plenty of supplements that you can take that will quote unquote speed up your metabolism they will turn it on they will get you going but they do not result in any additional fat loss for mechanisms in which we will cover later and so understanding the very basic principle there lets you realize okay great they can make a certain claim there but in reality it is what I&amp;#39;m trying to hear is that product will help me lose fat more and that will not be the case that is often what we see and have historically heard in the magazines in the media with the supplement companies and so forth regarding speeding up your metabolism so now that you understand that you&amp;#39;re not going to fall a prey to that trick again so here&amp;#39;s what we really mean when people say I want a faster metabolism or my metabolism is slow and so they say my metabolism is too slow or I want it to go faster what do they really saying they&amp;#39;re generally talking about body composition I hate to phrase it this way I didn&amp;#39;t want to do it because there&amp;#39;s so much more to metabolism than just body comp but again this is a very easy entry point for us so we&amp;#39;ll stay here just so most people can understand so when they&amp;#39;re saying that my metabolism is slow what they&amp;#39;re usually saying is a comment about their body composition they have more fat than they would like it&amp;#39;s hard for them to lose fat it&amp;#39;s hard for them to gain muscle or the opposite someone who complains of a fast metabolism is somebody who&amp;#39;s having a hard time gaining muscle I eat and I eat and I eat I just can&amp;#39;t gain I eat and I eat I just can&amp;#39;t gain so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s complaints on both sides of the equation example here just to give you some math let&amp;#39;s say both you and your friend eat 1,500 calories a day and let&amp;#39;s say we live in a magical universe and stress and sleep and all that is all equated for the only difference between you you both add 1500 calories per day for eight weeks one of you loses 3 PB the other loses 12 PB that is a real thing that can and does happen it&amp;#39;s easy then for you to think okay tabolism Fast Metabolism slope so what&amp;#39;s really happening there is a change in what we call TDE or total daily energy expenditure when you hear the phrase fast and slow metabolism where the phrase is I want you to think total daily energy expenditure now that has four unique components and I&amp;#39;ll cover in one second but the reality it is what could be explaining that person who lost more weight than you did or didn&amp;#39;t gain as much whether you&amp;#39;re in a caloric Surplus or choric deficit it doesn&amp;#39;t matter something in that total daily energy expenditure was different for them there is no in that component that is metabolic speed but that&amp;#39;s the translation all right so boost metabolism is really an increase or decrease in total daily energy expenditure if you want to look at total body mass body composition we can look at this as simply as our energy expenditure versus our energy intake a lot of times you&amp;#39;ll see this abbreviated is EI energy intake so I can increase or decrease my weight by changing either side of my equation for example if I increased my total daily energy expenditure of which I have four ways to do that four components but if I increase that and I didn&amp;#39;t increase my intake my body mass will go down or I could keep my energy expenditure the same and I could lower my energy intake okay or combinations of both but that&amp;#39;s honestly what we&amp;#39;re what we&amp;#39;re talking about when we&amp;#39;re discussing metabolic speed I&amp;#39;m actually fine with people saying I&amp;#39;ve sped up my metabolism as long as we&amp;#39;re using it appropriately in this context I don&amp;#39;t like to use it but I absolutely get it why most folks do and so total daily energy expenditure as I said has four components what are those four components the first one is what we call eat eat some people call this e what we&amp;#39;re effectively talking about is exercise so eat stands for the exercise activity thermogenesis it&amp;#39;s the calories you burn during exercise e is energy expenditure it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how you think about this but it&amp;#39;s how many calories did you burn in your workout for most people that&amp;#39;s going to represent somewhere between Z to 30% of their total daily energy expenditure so just to make sure you&amp;#39;re following me of all the calories you burn throughout the day everything combined if you don&amp;#39;t work out well then none of their caloric expenditure is going to be explained by exercise most people though probably going to have 10 to 20% of the calories they burn throughout the day coming from exercise folks that really training a lot maybe closer to 20 25 or even up to 30% it&amp;#39;s hard to get past 30% you would have to train a ton but you can generally think 10 20% of your energy throughout the day coming from calories we will talk about this later but this is one of the reasons why and and I it will explain very clearly why this is the wrong thing to think but this is the F some people use to say things like oh exercise doesn&amp;#39;t even help with fat loss and they&amp;#39;re not not entirely wrong here because it&amp;#39;s not explaining the largest part of your caloric expenditure 10% even for someone who works out pretty often or pretty hard 90% of the calories you&amp;#39;re burning are from things not exercised so they&amp;#39;re not completely unfounded though again I think it&amp;#39;s really terrible advice we&amp;#39;ll talk about that and the research on it in detail later but again component number one of total daily energy expenditure is exercise component number two is similar to eat which is called neat so it&amp;#39;s eat with an n in front of it it is non exercise activity thermogenesis this is all the other physical activity you&amp;#39;re doing throughout the day that is not structured and specific exercise this is everything from fidgeting to walking pacing taking the stairs going uh parking further in the parking lot so you walk more it is all of those other things that are still going to expend calories but they&amp;#39;re not exercise one of the interesting things about this is this has often times as much if not a bigger component of your total energy expenditure than structured exercise does people have completely forgotten about this but the reality of it is it&amp;#39;s going to be somewhere between 5 to 30% of your TDE the next two components are what&amp;#39;s called your TEF and I apologize for all the acronyms here I&amp;#39;m trying to really make sure we walk you through it I I think you&amp;#39;re holding on this far it is the thermal effect of food this is quite simply the energies or the heat you create in response to breaking down food in your stomach so the reality is when you eat food items they sit in your stomach you have to burn some calories to digest them if you want to think about it that way and that then creates some choric expenditure it&amp;#39;s usually about 8 to 15% of your TDE and so if you add eat neat and TEF up what you have remaining of that 100% is your resting metabolic rate and that ranges from about 40% % of TDE all the way up to 80% especially in folks that are sedentary or lowly active so as we get into this how I&amp;#39;m going to cover the intervention and the research is which area of total daily energy expenditure is each given protocol or intervention influencing so what can we do to increase our eat what can we do to increase neat TEF as well as resting metabolic rate the reality as I said at the beginning I think it&amp;#39;s best that you tried to implement a well-rounded plan that influences all four of these components or at least multiple of them but if you can&amp;#39;t exercise say you&amp;#39;re injured or bedridden or you&amp;#39;re in another scenario where you can&amp;#39;t exercise or whatever the case may be you have other options and that&amp;#39;s why I want to present all this stuff is so you know no matter what situation you&amp;#39;re in based on preference or realistic or feasibility or Effectiveness you can alter your metabolism in in multiple Fashions to make sure that your body composition and overall energy intake is where you want it to be whether that&amp;#39;s loss gain or maintenance for that matter if you enjoyed this clip you can watch the full episode by clicking here
