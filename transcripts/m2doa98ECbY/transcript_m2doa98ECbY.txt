how specifically things like creatine actually enhance brain function we you can take this actually from both ankles this is like actual cognitive function first of all does it like if I take creatine right now am I G to have a Improvement in cognitive function and then what about long-term brain as well so kind of two-part question there about creatin specific I guess we&amp;#39;ll just start there yeah and then how actually it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s doing those if it is at all so whether you would see a significant benefit from creatine right now probably depends a little you take your dose of 10 grams and like what are you going to see uh it probably depends a little bit on your context but you you probably saw the recent paper that showed that after one night of sleep deprivation you know creatine can overcome some of those deficits ctively cognitively yeah and that&amp;#39;s that was actually shown um a few years ago uh with skill rugby skills in rugby players you may have seen that paper as well where they had players after a period of sleep deprivation they gave them either creative or caffeine and saw similar improvements in uh like rugby specific skills compared to a placebo yeah with a very different mechanism here right you&amp;#39;re talking about a stimulant and versus a fuel right totally opposite yeah so uh however you could probably relate both of those to energetics in some way because caffeine is overcoming or it&amp;#39;s inhibiting the metabolic downregulation caused by adenosine um which is part of what drives you know sleep pressure in the need for sleep as you accumulate metabolites like adenosine they then um sort of suppress metabolic activity in the brain um which then is associated with reduced function and something like caffeine overcomes that whereas creatine can acutely uh provide a buffer uh energetic buffer that allows you to maintain function in the face of um sort of increasing metabolic pressure to to sleep so even though different mechanisms they kind of maybe converge on on something similar I know a lot of people who you know every time they take Crea in they notice like an immediate sort of boost of some kind cognitive function yeah um and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s been a lot of discussion over the years about whether creatine negatively impact sleep um for that reason it&amp;#39;s sort of it&amp;#39;s slightly stimulating for some people um I&amp;#39;ve certainly found that in myself like if I take cre I I work out in the afternoon if I take creatine after my workouts I don&amp;#39;t sleep as well but if I take it first thing in the morning it&amp;#39;s fine because I&amp;#39;ve kind of separated it away and not everybody&amp;#39;s like that and certainly we know that uh responses to creatine are very heterogeneous right some people see totally big uh big responses some people see see smaller responses and some of it&amp;#39;s may be related to methylation status because creatine uh when we make our own which we make a lot of is the most methylation intensive process in the body you spend Mo like more of your methal groups producing creatine than anything else um and so it could be related to that as well as you know a whole host of you know how much creatine do you normally have in your diet and and things like that how is creatin actually providing fuel for your brain um and then on the second part of that is what&amp;#39;s the normal fuel yeah for our brain when you think about uh different Energy Systems and I think people could uh watch endless lectures from you talking about different Energy Systems in in uh in exercise and those principles in some ways are very similar um in the brain although the majority of cells in the brain you know like like we said earlier derived uh derive energy from glucose goes through glycolysis then enters the electron you know the pate and or laxas pyate goes into the electron transport chain in the mitochondria but there&amp;#39;s all of that is done to generate high energy phosphates fire usually or mainly ATP right so ATP is your energy current sort of a much shorter term um energy currency or that allows you to recycle ATP when you&amp;#39;ve used it up is the phosphocreatine system so um your creatine is phosphorated with a high energy phosphate and you use that to regenerate ATP so for very energetically expensive uh processes where you can&amp;#39;t get enough energy through that longer process glycolysis and aerobic metabolism then the buffer comes from the fos creatine system and it seems that even for normal cognitive function um there is some benefit from having more of that buffer on board um uh both acutely and and chronically so just like your muscles yeah or any other part of your system they have to rely on energy the nerves need energy to conduct right and so people I guess sometimes don&amp;#39;t always grasp the fact that your brain when we say it&amp;#39;s energetically demanding it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s going through a ton of metabolism we have this connotation that muscle and Metabolism yeah kind of the thing but the brain is metabolism yeah as well your basil metabolic rate the amount of energy you burn throughout the day you&amp;#39;re fast or slow metabolism all these things are it&amp;#39;s in your brain yeah as well and so it produces energy much like anything else it can use fat as a fuel source theoretically it can use carbohydrates it could use ketones or anything else and then creatine just like it is in your muscle provides that stochiometry of of one to one right so not a lot of energy per molecule creatine so it gets used up and turned and burned quickly but the upside is it gives you that energy really fast and so while you&amp;#39;re maybe slow to metabolize and you mentioned this so we&amp;#39;ll bring it up your brain will actually then generate lactate yeah so if you&amp;#39;re thinking really hard and thinking a long time are you like feeling the burn in your brain is that lactate building up is that what&amp;#39;s happening I don&amp;#39;t think uh lactate doesn&amp;#39;t accumulate it just gets generated and and used you probably couldn&amp;#39;t uh you you could you could probably measure um so so this is where I think creating becomes important and and you potentially if if I put micro dialysis needles really you know accurately in certain parts of the brain and then you you start to upregulate the use of that Network for a specific function because there&amp;#39;s going to be a slight delay between increased ATP production um and the requirement right you need you you actually need that energy before you realize you need it right everything that we see and do has essentially already happened because of the time lag that it takes for us to actually interpret the those actions so that energy is needed immediately and it could be that because of the lag in the system you know upregulating uh energy production that&amp;#39;s where creating becomes important in in in a network as you activate it then you would probably start to see uh locally if you could meas you know measure it with uh say carbon dir metabolism or something you could have a radio tracer on your on your lactate and you could see that your asites which make your lactate for your neurons um will probably increase production because your neurons are more active in that area they&amp;#39;re going to require more energy they&amp;#39;ve used up their phosphocreatine system and then the asites locally going to produce more lactate none of it&amp;#39;s going to accumulate because it&amp;#39;s getting used but flux through the system is probably increasing if you enjoyed this
