xcode-select --install
```

If you already have the tools installed, you’ll receive a message stating that they are already present.

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

With the command line tools installed, it's time to install Homebrew. You can find the installation command on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh). Copy the installation command, which usually looks something like this:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Paste it into your Terminal and follow the prompts, including entering your password when required. 

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

Once the installation completes, you can verify it by running:

```bash
brew help
```

If you see a list of commands, Homebrew was installed successfully!

## Using Homebrew

### Searching for Packages

To find available packages, use:

```bash
brew search [package_name]
```

For example, to search for PostgreSQL:

```bash
brew search postgresql
```

### Installing Packages

To install a package, simply use:

```bash
brew install [package_name]
```

For example, to install the `tree` command:
