what should I do to enhance my brain function right now and I can&amp;#39;t Define that I don&amp;#39;t know if that means I need to be creative I don&amp;#39;t know if that means I need to have more you know reaction time what like where would you start with that individual in terms of what you said at the beginning I you should make your own Baseline test like what should I be thinking about and are there some tactics where you say okay I need all the information I would really need all but maybe two or three things here that start off that generally work pretty well so so generally i&amp;#39; think about when something like that comes to me and they say I&amp;#39;m healthy my brain works great I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;d like to improve it as much as I can or maintain it for as long as possible the first thing is just to make sure if that first statement is true and the easiest way to do that is with some simple blood tests you know determine some like nutritional status becomes really critical for the brain we can um we can deal with poor nutritional status and the brain works just fine early in life but if you&amp;#39;re trying to you know maximize everything we know uh vitamin D iron status magnesium uh B vitamins Omega-3s some of these and glucose glucose regulation or at least just making sure you don&amp;#39;t have pre-diabetes you know some of the basics I would just make sure that all of that is sort of buttoned up and that&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s easy to address would you mainly say those are energy metabolism markers as long as your energy metabolisms fine you&amp;#39;re probably okay there&amp;#39;s an interesting thing about energy metabolism in the brain and as it relates to brain structure as well which is that it kind of follows a U-shaped curve so at low levels of energy availability we start to lose brain structure and brain function just because we don&amp;#39;t have the energy to support it and then we see a very clear energy toxicity effect as well so if we have you know pre-diabetes diabetes um lipid disregulation you all the markers of energy toxicity which are very very common right 2third if not more adults in the US have some version of that then you start to see a decline in cive function and brain volume as well so yes energy regulation is really important but some of those nutrients have their own um effects in terms of brain structure as well so if you think about the relationship between B vitamins and Omega-3s this has been shown again and again and again that they interact so if you have good status of one but not the other you see no effect and vice versa and this is where we&amp;#39;ve had trials that say we give Omega-3s but they don&amp;#39;t work or we give B vitamins but they don&amp;#39;t work but they haven&amp;#39;t taking the the other into account and it makes perfect sense because if you want DHA the long chain omega3 fatty acid to sit in the sinapse where you want it you know to help communication between two neurons it needs to first get into the brain and that requires usually healthy uh instant sensitivity in energy regulation and then it needs to go down the path of being attached to some kind of phospholipid right so choline or Serene or ethanolamine uh so you need that to be available and then you need methylation to work so these things get attached together that&amp;#39;s where the B Vis become important so some of these things are directly structural uh as well as being you know functional thinking about energy M and mitochondria I don&amp;#39;t want to lose the plot I&amp;#39;ll come back to our Avatar here in a second I have many follow-ups to that I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll ask just one though I don&amp;#39;t think people would have assumed you can get a reasonable assessment of shortterm immediate acute cognitive function from blood so uh right now you probably can&amp;#39;t um you and I are in the process of uh developing what should be a fairly simple uh blood test that relates directly to cognitive function dementia risk also mortality risk but like I said critically cognitive function right now it&amp;#39;s not going to be perfect but it does relate generally to nutritional status and energy status which which makes perfect sense so on top of that I think you could um you know really button up the details with making sure that all you have all your nutrient ducts uh in a row but in reality if you were going to try at the population level at least try and predict some of these cognitive function you could see or if they have pre-diabetes or any kind of um nutrient deficiency they&amp;#39;re going to have lower cognitive function and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s you know dozens hundreds of studies that show that do they need to necessarily be at a technical deficiency there or if they&amp;#39;re you know say bottom 10th percentile they should pay attention do we have any insights into where those cut offs start to lie for these metrics yeah it it probably you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re right that in general what we consider to be a a deficiency nowadays is usually you&amp;#39;re below the normal range right you&amp;#39;re in the bottom 2.5% of some nutrient marker and right you&amp;#39;re like you&amp;#39;re going to have some your day-to-day cognitive function is not your ma your main issue right there&amp;#39;s going to be even bigger problems than that but there are some cut offs for for all of these things uh well in in general say blood sugar regulation you want to make sure that normal fasting blood sugar not pre-diabetic beyond that there&amp;#39;s probably not that much benefit from from from being lower than that but something like homine as a marker of methylation status um generally if you went to a lab the normal range is 13 15 um five to five to like bottom end five high end 13 14 15 and most people will say you sort of like Target below 15 in terms of cognitive function it probably needs to be less than 11 uh some people would go a little bit lower than that for things like cardiovascular disease risk um but then uh similarly for omega-3 fatty acids if you do something like the omega-3 index you probably want to be like ideally over 6% maybe close to 8% or higher um and that like I said those those two things interact yeah I would say that in our experience if you are above 9 to 10 for home assisting we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re looking very seriously at other things yeah and an Omega you&amp;#39;d be surprised how many are under five yeah like very very very very commonly this is why you see in those folks a little bit of basic multivitamin and omega-3 support and all of a sudden the brain fog is gone the decline like it it just disappears from these people really quickly which is is really of no surprise so um coming back to us then we check those blood markers uh then what for that so then you can make sure that the other lifestyle factors are sort of all in a row and when we think about long-term cognitive function there&amp;#39;s kind of a a framework for thinking about that so sleep and all these other things stress mitigation um I&amp;#39;d I&amp;#39;d definitely you know look at all these other lifestyle factors but if you&amp;#39;re thinking about enhancing cognitive function like I said earlier I think stimulus is really the most important thing your avatar probably has quite a cognitively stimulating job which we know uh increases long-term cognitive function and decreases the risk of dementia longterm so then I would think about a a lifelong plan of ongoing broad cognitive stimuli so if he&amp;#39;s never played a musical instrument he learns to play a musical instrument if he um all his exercise is in the gym and it&amp;#39;s uni modal then he picks up an open skill sport he goes to play pickle ball or learns to skateball God forbid no more people playing pickle ball don&amp;#39;t do that Tommy um if he uh has never spoken another language then he then he learns a language um some of these things it&amp;#39;s interesting when you look across the literature the one activity that probably takes a lot of these boxes and seems to really support cognitive function as well as mental health is dancing and because that brings in play like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an open skill there&amp;#39;s music it&amp;#39;s social um so he so dance class with his partner right would be a great a great way to sort of integrate a bunch of these things together if you enjoyed this clip you
