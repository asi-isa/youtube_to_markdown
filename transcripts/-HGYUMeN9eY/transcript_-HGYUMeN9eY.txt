the science and practice of enhancing human performance for sport play and life Welcome to perform I&amp;#39;m Dr Andy Galpin I&amp;#39;m a professor and scientist and the executive director of the human performance center at Parker University in today&amp;#39;s conversation I&amp;#39;m going to be talking to my friend Dr Tommy wood Tommy has an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from Cambridge University a medical degree from Oxford as well as a PhD in physiology and Neuroscience Tommy is now running his neonatal Neuroscience Lab at the University of Washington in addition to all that he is a well-versed rower and strongman and has worked with athletes across every sport and in particular more recently focusing a lot on Formula 1 drivers and I say all this to help you understand that Tommy&amp;#39;s ability to run back and forth between physiology and Science and application in human performance is really unparalleled in the area of brain health and cognitive function so in our discussions today we talk a lot about those areas we talk about how to enhance understand identify short-term cognitive performance what that even means what that looks like from an exercise and supplementation and Technology perspective and then we talk about how that looks in the long term so how do we prevent and even deter or eliminate things like dementia and brain aging and Tommy over the course of our discussion will bring up at least five points that I feel like are quite counterintuitive or in other words are going to surprise or potentially even aggravate some folks out there the reality of it is I don&amp;#39;t think a lot of us truly understand the current state of the literature on both short and long-term cognitive function and Tommy does a wonderful job in this conversation of bringing that to the Forefront so we really are more understanding of of what the literature says and how that transfers into practical application another thing I think worth mentioning here that we get into that I get asked about all the time is how things like exercise have a causal effect on brain health of course there&amp;#39;s a correlation between you know strong muscle and physical performance and how well you age but how is it directly impacting and how is that I causal if it is at all Tomley wonderfully walks us through all that in a way that I think everyone can comprehend and get a great grasp on so with all that in mind I hope you thoroughly enjoyed this conversation today with Dr Tommy wood Dr Tommy wood welcome to perform thanks so much for having me I&amp;#39;m really excited to be here with you there&amp;#39;s a lot of things I want to get into today um things that you and I have chatted about before but mostly things that I actually don&amp;#39;t know the answer to um hopefully I can pry some information out of you about enhancing brain performance uh things that we can do now in the short term as well as long-term brain health um but I think before we can get to that for my own personal sake I know I say some of these things wrong so I&amp;#39;m hoping you can kind of fix this but maybe it would be best for us to just start off with what is cognitive performance how do you define that how should we think about it and what are the aspects of cognitive performance I think one issue that&amp;#39;s come up a lot recently in this in this field is that some of these things are actually very hard to Define so when we think about cognitive function more broadly the way that we&amp;#39;ve traditionally thought about it is how do you perform on some standard cognitive test like an IQ test um and then there are tests for a whole bunch of other functions like executive function or response inhibition right trying to uh suppress the desire to to make a response uh which is an important part of planning and the prefrontal cortex is plays a big role there um also testing working memory and all these other things that we might um or you our ability to learn and remember in short periods of time and that&amp;#39;s kind of what we&amp;#39;ve had because that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got we have standardized tests we know how you score compared to other people we think we understand which parts of the brain are involved in those functions but the the real problem is that while they do relate slightly to the different functions you and I would want to do from dayto day it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s an imperfect Association and beyond that there are a whole uh Suite of cognitive functions or things that we do with our brain that you can&amp;#39;t really measure with those tests so part of the problem is um defining what is it that you want your brain to do um and you almost have to become sort of your own Baseline because I can test your executive function and I can test your working memory but if you&amp;#39;re an artist those things don&amp;#39;t relate to that at all um and there you know you can do some standardized uh tests of creativity and stuff like that but it&amp;#39;s just not the same so I think a cognitive function in reality is very personal and it depends on what you want your brain to do and when you want your brain to do it but I think that if we&amp;#39;re trying to Define brain health for one of a better word it is having a brain that does those things so some understanding of what you want to do when you want to do it and how can you support your brain in doing that okay so the way that I pun intended my brain puts this together is I think about when I say brain health I&amp;#39;m referring to do I have lesions in my brain do I have brain damage and then when I think of cognitive function I&amp;#39;m usually thinking about perform right so Reaction Time memory word recall executive function is that a fair way to characterize it or should I add a third part there or I think about brain health more holistically and in reality we know that structure and function in the brain are directly linked um the the brain has quite a lot of redundancy so you can lose function in an area and either recover it or maybe you don&amp;#39;t even notice that that function is lost um so so I wouldn&amp;#39;t even necessarily separate them out in that way I think it would depend on what you&amp;#39;re measuring so we can measure brain health based on an EEG signal like different electrical activity and different regions of the brain how those different networks are connected we can also measure brain health in terms of well how do you how do you feel today because that&amp;#39;s essentially an integrated output of all the different things that your brain is experiencing so that&amp;#39;s why I think about brain health more broadly um and that relates both to um minute to- minute performance and enhancing that as well as what&amp;#39;s your long-term trajectory of function and you know are you then at risk of significant detriment of function and dementia long term right like clearly if I have some physical structure damaged in my brain I won&amp;#39;t have the acute performance either yeah right I&amp;#39;m going to have some however that may manifest itself could be any of the examples you said but does that work backwards as well in other words U because I&amp;#39;m maybe having a hard time with some form of cognitive function does that indicate some likelihood of actually having some structural damage as well or are those is that street one way because of the redundancy in the structural systems you don&amp;#39;t necessarily um have a direct one toone connection um and you&amp;#39;ll probably lose or for some people you lose some functions or the the functions decline before you can see say on brain Imaging oh yes here&amp;#39;s a uh some atrophy here&amp;#39;s some loss of volume or here&amp;#39;s damage and in a certain area so I think that may just be partly because of the uh the resolution of the things that we can measure so maybe we get to a point where you have a really really strong MRI and we can see in very fine detail all the little blood vessels and all the you know small parts of all the regions of the brain and then you could get a more direct connection so I think they are very closely connected and if you if you&amp;#39;re losing a function you there&amp;#39;s probably going to be a structural correlate of that but in all likelihood because function is also going to be driven by you know nutrient status mitochondrial function some of these other things you might start to have issues with function before you see a structural um issue on a brain scan or something like that okay if then that is true if I improve some sort of I&amp;#39;ll just keep calling these short-term acute functionalities How likely is that then to carry over into long-term brain health the the way that I think about the brain is uh because I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m a bit of a meathead as you know I I enjoy lifting weights and the more time I spent studying the brain uh the more the brain could uh be be thought to respond similar to say skeletal muscle in response to exercise so all the things that you&amp;#39;ve spent decades researching these processes are very similar in the brain and what that really means is that function is driven by stimulus just like if you&amp;#39;re trying to get uh strong and jacked you need to apply uh mechanical tension to the skeletal muscle right regardless of everything else that you do and you can improve you can improve that response with sleep and nutrition and things like that but no stimulus no response and the brain is essentially the same and what you see is that when you stimulate certain networks or areas of the brain with certain activities in response you then see an improvement in structure because structure comes from that stimulus and then the way that the brain responds to it and the brain is capable of that pretty much throughout the entire lifespan that&amp;#39;s really interesting because almost always when we hear this stuff talked about we hear it in the sense of neuroplasticity right so you have a capacity issue some neurological adaptation which you know it is structural but for the most time we don&amp;#39;t think about that as a structural change we just think it as a functional yeah right so you have a new capacity your action time is faster your word Rec whatever right but what you&amp;#39;re actually saying is there&amp;#39;s also a as noticeable physical change akin to muscle right so when I get my when I train my muscle I have neurological adaptations that make me stronger I also have larger biceps I&amp;#39;m not assuming I don&amp;#39;t have a larger brain right well you obviously the the space within the skull is limited but to some extent you do have a larger brain and we know that with um Aging in particular and as you follow trajectory say into dementia your brain gets smaller right you get atrophy of the brain you can then see increases in the volume of the brain in response to certain stimuli so you can get particularly once the the volume of the brain has started to decline as you get older you can see then a response in terms of volume with certain stimuli so that&amp;#39;s not just neuronal connections um but it part of it is so you have uh your density of connections right that&amp;#39;s the neuroplasticity you know new neurons talking to each other early on in the the loss of volume of the brain um people think about neurons dying but actually that happens quite late what&amp;#39;s happening is those neurons themselves are just shrinking up so they&amp;#39;re still there they still have the capacity for function buty before Aptos yeah and if you&amp;#39;re not using them right they will then follow that trajectory but they that can be recovered Plus neurons make up less than 50% of the cells in the brain you have multiple other cell types you have a huge vascular Network in the brain and so when you&amp;#39;re improving volume you&amp;#39;re also improving other cell types you know the extracellular Matrix is really important in terms of all the proteins that that sort of regulate how the cells interact so yes you can improve volume it&amp;#39;s not just neurons though and I think often we focus on neurons but really there&amp;#39;s so much else going on at the same time man I&amp;#39;m totally guilty of that like I just I know certain aspects of the Brain Change physically in a good or bad way in response to you know perturbations but I just always give it the the neural plasticity twist so I&amp;#39;d love to come back to that um I want to know more about it but I got to ask since we&amp;#39;re right here I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any more debate at least in my understanding of the literature anymore about whether or not exercise and things like that are good for long-term brain health yeah what there is considerable debate on though is can you actually improve cognitive function right now you said this earlier if you want to do an IQ test and then I coach you on that IQ test you will improve yeah um you could probably pick about every metric in the brain possible but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean you&amp;#39;re getting better cognitive function it just means the brain is is neuroplastic and achieves an adaptation response to stimuli so I&amp;#39;m more interested in in where you stand on that Global argument um first of all is there even argument is it pretty well scientifically established where&amp;#39;s that field lie and then you know overall tell me can we actually improve cognitive function and then for sure if we can I want to know how so again it really depends who you ask and how you&amp;#39;re measuring asking yeah you&amp;#39;re asking me but if you were to if you were to sample a large number of cognitive neuroscientists um and even some of the people that I work with some will say yes you can improve cognitive function and some will say no you can&amp;#39;t um and this is partly driven by how we&amp;#39;re testing it right which we which we&amp;#39; kind of covered and yes we know that um people who spend longer in education they have uh improved cognitive function but part of it is just because they get better at taking tests yeah right and when any study does longitudinal testing of cognitive function everybody gets better even the control group because they get just get better at taking the test so then when you&amp;#39;re thinking about when you&amp;#39;re thinking longterm which we&amp;#39;ll come back to uh I think there is a good amount of evidence that we can improve cognitive function when when it&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;re in a period of decline but then if you&amp;#39;re thinking right now how can I improve my cognitive function I think the way that I think about it is again related to skill development and what it is that we actually want our our brains to do and the human brain um more so than any other species is evolved to adapt to the environment so that it can optimally perform within that environment that means that whatever you want your brain to do and if you train it in the right way you will improve function any skill learning language Sports um and then beyond then when you&amp;#39;ve done that you have improved cognitive function right you&amp;#39;re using your brain to perform some skill you have improved at that over time and your cognitive function has therefore improved we also know that there then carry over from specific skill learning to more broader cognitive function particularly uh longer term but if you define it that way I think that we know that the process of skill development is the process of enhancing cognitive function and then it&amp;#39;s just a case of how do I maximize that adaptation and how do I maximize the expression of that skill once I&amp;#39;ve attained it today&amp;#39;s episode is sponsored by ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral drink with probiotics prebiotics and adaptive initially I was extremely skeptical of ag1 as I am with all supplement companies but after months of discussions with their lead nutrition scientists and the general team at ag1 I&amp;#39;ve been impressed by a1&amp;#39;s commitment to sourcing the highest quality ingredients and constantly updating their formulas to have the right ingredients in the optimal amounts ag1 also rigorously tests their products to ensure that every single batch is free of ban substances allergens heavy metals microbes pesticides herbicides residual solvents and microtox it&amp;#39;s even earned the prestigious NSF certified for sport thirdparty testing approval stamp now most people in the performance space talk a lot about macronutrients like protein carbohydrates and fats and these are obviously critically important but so are the micronutrients like vitamins and minerals and even if you&amp;#39;re eating a healthy diet it&amp;#39;s often hard to get enough of these vitamins and minerals along with their probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to keep your body performing at its best it&amp;#39;s for these reasons and many others that I personally take ag1 almost every day now it&amp;#39;s of course not a replacement for eating whole healthy foods but it is a great way to make sure that you&amp;#39;re plugging in any gaps in your nutrition to improve your energy bolster your immune system and just generally help promote a healthy gut microbiome and more if you&amp;#39;d like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com perform to receive five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 plus K2 again that&amp;#39;s drink a1.com perform to receive five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 plus K2 if I want to improve creativity just do more creative tasks yes if I want to improve memory practice memory yes and this probably expands to any way we would Define cognitive function for a normal young healthy person right so actionable step number one would be simply that right if you want to get better at writing WR I I that was one of my favorite I had a a friend several friends who are writer and it&amp;#39;s stunning how low energy last minute that they can pull up smash out 3,000 words and you&amp;#39;re like that would have taken me months months to write right this is what they do naturally that makes a ton of sense where is the broader applicability are there any maybe specific domains of cognitive function that have better transferability to others uh are there any particular types whether this is maybe exercise or nutrition or brain training devices or tactics that have a a more wide ranging again broader applicability or is it all pretty much they&amp;#39;re going to be good on their individual one and then have very little transfer so this is the principle of near transfer versus far transfer so near transfer means that you learn to get good at the thing that you want to get good at and then it doesn&amp;#39;t really translate elsewhere it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been the problem with um brain training uh as has typically been done for the past few decades and that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why people think you can&amp;#39;t enhance cognitive function is because when you do brain training what you get better at is just some version of the test that doesn&amp;#39;t then make you a better functioning person out in the real world but if your NE transfer is relevant to you say it&amp;#39;s writing or some other kind of specific Skiller language right then near transfer can be enough but we also know that if you&amp;#39;re trying to think about uh so far transfer so improving some cognitive function that then translates to other cognitive functions then activities that um train certain aspects of decision- making in the prefrontal in the prefrontal cortex they seem to be associated with some uh some Far transfer just you get you get better at regulating your own internal thought and decision- making processes and that relates to a wide variety of of scenarios then um some of the other things that you mentioned like exercise is one that supports and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s exercise specific so resistance training and aerobic training have effects on different areas of the brain and both good but different yeah both good but different um but then that applies to to functions more broadly right you&amp;#39;re going for a run and that you know aerobic exercise is particularly good at um improving certain aspects of memory and so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you&amp;#39;re memorizing right memory is is is broadly uh enhanced so some of the the lifestyle factors that we know are are critical for for brainal and cognitive function they broadly support cognitive function as well as um skill learning in the first place um but then some specific skills may be you know just just related to to to that skill as as you use it okay I&amp;#39;m going to give you a couple of avatars here and uh I&amp;#39;m asking this personally imagine uh because you&amp;#39;ve worked with athletes across I mean gez every sport imaginable you&amp;#39;ve worked with uh industry folks you&amp;#39;ve worked with non-athletes uh you&amp;#39;ve done concussion stuff you&amp;#39;ve done aging stuff so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re all over the map in terms of your skill set M so with this uh somebody comes to you and says hey look my brain&amp;#39;s healthy um I&amp;#39;m 40 years old I&amp;#39;m not super worried about Dimension Alzheimer&amp;#39;s things like that I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m My Lifestyle factors are exercise I do all you know I sleep well I don&amp;#39;t drink I don&amp;#39;t smoke so on and so forth I don&amp;#39;t have a thing I&amp;#39;m looking for I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m looking for I maybe run a company I have kids something like that what should I do to enhance my brain function right now and I can&amp;#39;t Define that I don&amp;#39;t know if that means I need to be creative I don&amp;#39;t know if that means I need to have more you know reaction time what like where would you start with that individual in terms of what you said at the beginning I you should make your own Baseline test like what should I be thinking about and are there some tactics where you say okay I need all the information I would really need all but maybe two or three things here that start off that generally work pretty well so generally I&amp;#39;d think about when somebody like that comes to me and they say I&amp;#39;m healthy my brain works great um I&amp;#39;d like to improve it as much as I can or maintain it for as long as possible the first thing is just to make sure if that first statement is true and the easiest way to do that is with some simple blood tests you know determine some like nutritional status becomes really critical for the brain we can um we can deal with poor nutritional status the brain works just fine early in life but if you&amp;#39;re trying to you know maximize everything we know uh vitamin D iron status magnesium uh B vitamins Omega-3s some of these and glucose glucose regulation or at least just making sure you don&amp;#39;t have pre-diabetes you know some of the basics I would just make sure that all of that is sort of buttoned up and that&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s easy to address would you mainly say those are energy metabolism markers as long as your energy metabolisms fine you&amp;#39;re probably okay there&amp;#39;s an interesting thing uh about energy metabolism in the brain and as it relates to brain structure as well which is that it kind of follows a U-shaped curve so at low levels of energy availability we start to lose brain structure and brain function just because we don&amp;#39;t have the energy to support it and then we see a very clear energy toxicity effect as well so if we have you know pre-diabetes diabetes um lipid disregulation you all the markers of energy toxicity which are very very common right 2third if not more adults in the US have some version of that then you start to see a decline in cognitive function and brain volume as well so yes energy regulation is really important but some of those nutrients have their own um effects in terms of brain structure as well so if you think about the relationship between B vitamins and Omega-3s this has been shown again and again and again that they interact so if you have good status of one but not the other you see no effect and vice versa and this is where we&amp;#39;ve had trials that say we give Omega-3s but they don&amp;#39;t work or we give B vitamins but they don&amp;#39;t work but they haven&amp;#39;t taken the the other into account and it makes perfect sense because if you want DHA the longchain omega-3 fatty acid to sit in the sinapse where you want it you know to help communication between two neurons it needs to first get into the brain and that requires usually healthy uh instant sensitivity and energy regulation and then it needs to go down the path of being attached to some kind of phospholipid right so choline or serine or ethanolamine uh so you need that to be available and then you need methylation to work so these things get attached together that&amp;#39;s where the B Vis become important so some of these things are directly structural uh as well as being you know functional thinking about energy and M and mitochondria I don&amp;#39;t want to lose the plot I&amp;#39;ll come back to our Avatar here in a second I have many follow-ups to that I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll ask just one though I don&amp;#39;t think people would have assumed you can get a reasonable assessment of short-term immediate acute cognitive function from blood H so uh right now you probably can&amp;#39;t um you and I are in the process of uh uh developing what should be a fairly simple uh blood test that relates directly to cognitive function dementia risk or morality risk but like I said critically cognitive function right now it&amp;#39;s not going to be perfect but it does relate generally to nutritional status and energy status which which makes perfect sense so on top of that I think you could um you know really button up the details with making sure that all you have all your nutrient ducts uh in a row but in reality if you&amp;#39;re going to try at the population level at least try and predict some of these cognitive function you could see or if they have pre-diabetes or any kind of um nutrient deficiency they&amp;#39;re going to have low cognitive function and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s you know dozens hundreds of studies that show that do they need to necessarily be at a technical deficiency there or or if they&amp;#39;re you know say bottom 10th percentile they should pay attention do we have any insights and where those cut offs start to lie for these metrics yeah it it probably you you&amp;#39;re right that in general what we consider to be a a deficiency nowadays is usually you&amp;#39;re below the normal range right you&amp;#39;re in the bottom 2.5% of some nutrient marker and right you like you&amp;#39;re going to have some your day-to-day cognitive function is not your ma your main issue right there&amp;#39;s going to be even bigger problems than that but there are some cut offs for for all of these things uh well in in general say blood sugar regulation you want to make sure that normal fasting blood sugar not pre-diabetic beyond that there&amp;#39;s probably not that much benefit from from from being lower than that but something like homocystine is a marker of methylation status um generally if you went to a lab the normal range is 13 15 um five to five to like bottom end five high end 13 14 15 and most people will say you sort of like Target below 15 in terms of cognitive function it probably needs to be less than 11 uh some people would go a little bit lower than that for things like cardiovascular disease risk um but then uh similarly for omega-3 fatty acids if you do something like the omega-3 index you probably want to be like ideally over 6% maybe close to 8% or higher um and that like I said those those two things inter right yeah I would say that in our experience if you are above N9 to 10 for home assisting we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re looking very seriously at other things yeah and an Omega you&amp;#39;d be surprised how many are under five yeah like very very very very commonly this is why you see in those folks a little bit of basic multivitamin and omega-3 support and all of a sudden the brain fog is gone the decline like it&amp;#39;s it just disappears from these people really quickly which is is really of no surprise so um coming back to us then we check those blood markers uh then what for that so then you can make sure that the other lifestyle factors are sort of all in a row and when we think about long-term cognitive function there&amp;#39;s kind of a a framework for thinking about that so sleep and all these other things stress mitigation um i&amp;#39; i&amp;#39; definitely you know look at all these other lifestyle factors but if you&amp;#39;re thinking about enhancing cognitive function like I said earlier I think stimulus is really the most important thing your avatar probably has quite a cognitively stimulating job which we know uh increases long-term function and decrease the risk of dementia long term so then I would think about a lifelong plan of ongoing broad cognitive stimuli so if he&amp;#39;s never played a musical instrument he learns to play a musical instrument if he um all his exercise is in the gym and it&amp;#39;s uni modal then he picks up an open skill sport he goes to play pickle ball or learns to skateball God forbid no more people playing pickle ball don&amp;#39;t do that Tommy um if he uh has never spoken another language then he then he learns the language um some of these things it&amp;#39;s interesting when you look across the literature the one activity that probably takes a lot of these boxes and seems to really support cognitive function as well as mental health is dancing and because that brings in play like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an open skill there&amp;#39;s music it&amp;#39;s social um so he so dance class with his partner right would be a great a great way to sort of integrate a bunch of these things together cognitive demanding what does that actually mean that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a question that I actually can&amp;#39;t answer I talk about cognitive demand a bunch but in reality we don&amp;#39;t know like it&amp;#39;s a the it&amp;#39;s a theoretical concept because we could put you in an MRI scanner and we could see which areas of your brain become active or we could do the same thing with EEG but in reality like how do I quantify the stimulus that&amp;#39;s being put on you um compared to somebody else I mean we can&amp;#39;t like what&amp;#39;s the equivalent of volume in the brain it like compared to say lifting weights where I can quantify how many bicep curls did I do um what was the weight um you you could look at velocity and all these other things we can&amp;#39;t do that with the brain so yet and so I kind of hope that one day we&amp;#39;ll be able to quantify that so then we could say this is the cognitive demand that you&amp;#39;re getting this is the stimulus and this is is the adaptation that we expect to see but right now some of it is still a bit theoretical um and when you think about cognitive stimulus and cognitive enhancement one of the reasons why there&amp;#39;s so much controversy is because it&amp;#39;s actually quite a young field like we&amp;#39;re where exercise like cognitive enhance the cognitive enhanc field is where exercise science was decades ago four or five decades ago maybe so the principles all make sense you can see it happen in animal models you can measure the fact that these neurons were activated um but how you truly dig down and quantify the networks being activated uh and the level of that activation or maybe what&amp;#39;s required in order to see u a response that&amp;#39;s something that still needs to be worked on Dance makes sense to me because you didn&amp;#39;t say these words but sensory input is a huge impact here right so proception in the case of dance it is hearing uh you&amp;#39;re feeling you&amp;#39;re feeling the other person probably you&amp;#39;re feeling the ground you don&amp;#39;t want to step on toes it is rhythmic uh different these are all different parts of the brain if that&amp;#39;s a fair way to say it and now you also have memory it&amp;#39;s this step and this step and this step right plus improv improvisation all the four or five different areas immediately make sense when you think about something like let&amp;#39;s just say pickle ball you said earlier if you are a skilled pickle ball player then the act of playing pickle ball is not as cognitively demanding I&amp;#39;m assuming as it was the the first week you played right now there&amp;#39;s still some because you&amp;#39;re reacting to the external environment change of Direction This is pro proception where am I at in space what shot am I going to make what&amp;#39;s the score all those things right but it&amp;#39;s not as high as it used to be the last time because parts of that experience now of where to put your hands how to swing your Technique have been now pushed to we&amp;#39;ll just call it subconscious right this is learning MH how you get better better at sports right yeah where the cognitive demand piece to me sets a little bit differently again I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m actually thinking about this correctly because if I think about a day-to-day work experience for me the dance thing makes sense because of all those different sensory inputs when I think cognitive demand I&amp;#39;m thinking some sort of difficult mental task I&amp;#39;m not thinking like a physical body movement right so I&amp;#39;m thinking if I&amp;#39;m reading a scientific paper that to me feels like a high cognitive demanding task but in reality I can do that scrolling my fall like pretty quickly um and huous aside here like it does not take me long to scroll through a paper anymore and get the gist of do I buy it do I not buy it shoty paper where other folks I acly know say my just S as a graduate student like the whole day yeah reading every word right to get the gist of it is it just something that is a generally hard task if I&amp;#39;m doing if I&amp;#39;m writing is that always going to be a high cognitive demand if I&amp;#39;m sending an email is that always going to be low um I know for example just speaking from my relationship if my wife gives me information about something hang with the kids in school that&amp;#39;s the highest cognitive demanding effort I will have in my whole damn like wait who what&amp;#39;s the kid&amp;#39;s name again like I just have like I&amp;#39;m I have to drop everything and complete pay attention or else it goes to zero the next day she&amp;#39;ll remind me and I have zero recollection she&amp;#39;s probably if she listens to this she&amp;#39;s going to die in Anger listen because she&amp;#39;s like yeah it&amp;#39;s infuriating she does the same by the way so to the point of saying like is it the task itself is it novelty as long as I&amp;#39;m doing something different where where do we know that something is cog where can we get closer to guessing so novelty plays a big role and it&amp;#39;s probably because novelty drives attention and focus and if you&amp;#39;re actually going to respond to a stimulus you need to direct attentional resources to it so then difficulty becomes important as well so it should be challenging and you should be giving it your full attention and focus whatever it is and then those are probably some of the prerequisites in order to see some kind of adaptation in the brain how you subjectively feel about a task being difficult although I&amp;#39;m a big fan of the subjective for a lot of things in this uh case it it doesn&amp;#39;t really work really and it&amp;#39;s probably because of the way that we use our brains nowaday nowadays what you mentioned earlier listening to to your wife talk about something to do with the kids and you said the only reason the only way that you can actually internalize it if you like if you give her your attention so what that tells me is what you&amp;#39;re what you&amp;#39;re doing is multitasking um and you&amp;#39;re not actually multitasking what you&amp;#39;re doing is Task switching so you&amp;#39;re trying to pay attention to this thing in front of you right here and then you&amp;#39;re trying to pay attention to her and there&amp;#39;s a cost every time you do that because you have to refocus and what happens is if is essentially you&amp;#39;re not doing either or you&amp;#39;re doing both or three things very very poorly I think I set the world record for highest task switching cost Ever if I have to task s like that like it takes I have to literally sit down I&amp;#39;m like shake my head I&amp;#39;m like okay hold on give me a minute okay what like it takes the the lag it&amp;#39;s like a bad video game it&amp;#39;s so long on me when I switch tasks I&amp;#39;m just like I like I focus my whole day on not doing that because it is so catastrophic for me to have to do that yeah I I&amp;#39;ll I can do the task but I&amp;#39;ll have no memory of it yeah be gone for forever I&amp;#39;m actually very similar like I am a terrible task and like my wife always jokes I&amp;#39;m a terrible multitasker and recently you know I&amp;#39;ve leaded into it like the human brain cannot task switch like that efficiently people just can&amp;#39;t do it um you may have to be able to navigate that for for your job but in reality like work by Gloria Mark shows how um constant task switching is very stressful um and every time you switch a task you have that uh that cost of time as well as the fact that if you&amp;#39;re distracted from a task is it maybe a long period of time before you ever return to it and during that whole period of time while you&amp;#39;re not doing the task that you actually want to be doing right now there&amp;#39;s this sort of underlying simmering stress because you know it&amp;#39;s there but you&amp;#39;re not but you&amp;#39;re not doing it so I think a big part of this is that multitasking as we call it or task switching which is very common now email to this document you&amp;#39;re writing to social media it&amp;#39;s what uh a friend of mine James huitt calls the cognitive middle gear and you kind of imagine it so I I&amp;#39;ll keep going over to to my terrible exercise analogies but it&amp;#39;s kind of like spending all your time at threshold it&amp;#39;s incredibly like physically tiring but the adaptation you get from it is kind of disproportionate to how much it drains you yeah right yeah Yep this is the last couple of sets that you did where you got nothing different but you got high fatigue yes exactly and you&amp;#39;re doing that with your brain all day yeah so what you really want to do is to try and periodize that as much as you can right so you have your periods of intense Focus intense cognitive performance and that&amp;#39;s your deep work the time when you really need to get stuff done and then the rest of the time you&amp;#39;re sort of uh uh you&amp;#39;re doing your sort of like your your Zone to brain work and that can be answering emails like some of the basic stuff as soon as you start to do you know a ton of those things at the same time you start to to sort of head back into middle gear but that&amp;#39;s you kind of have to think about almost polarizing your your brain use just like a lot of people might poize their training your lab does mostly neonatal stuff yes right so your actual scientific time is mostly spent in young developing brain yeah right you&amp;#39;ve clearly done work across the entire lifespan does that task switching energy increase as you get older because I feel like when I was a kid I could task switch immediately I don&amp;#39;t actually have a recollection of it being a problem as like a grad student but now I&amp;#39;m like oh my gosh just detrimental and why I&amp;#39;m asking that is I&amp;#39;m wondering if that is the case could that be explaining some part of people feeling like they have cognitive decline feeling like their energy lower throughout the day feeling like their brain fog is hitting now when in reality they&amp;#39;re just burning more gas and they had no idea yeah particularly early on in life I think the brain interacts with the environment in the way that we should be doing as adults and we&amp;#39;re not doing if you watch a kid learning how to walk that is all they focused on right um and essentially for the first 30 years of life the brain is continuing to adapt and mature and it can still respond to stimulate after that but it takes almost half our lifetime for the brain to F to you know finish adapting to its environment and that adaptation is driven by learning these skills social interaction language motor skills but particularly early on that&amp;#39;s all the brain is is focused on doing right I&amp;#39;m going to spend this next 10 minutes trying to stand up and then I&amp;#39;m going to take a nap and you know you know my brain is going to start to figure out all the inputs that it received during that period of time had some days like that no doubt you know even now yeah and so then as you get into the teenage years I think that you&amp;#39;re right kids seem to be able to to jump back and forth continuously and that that probably is that they are better at focusing their attention very quickly and I think that&amp;#39;s partly because all the other things that we have to deal with when we&amp;#39;re older aren&amp;#39;t in place so a lot of what happens as we get older and we think that our cognitive function is diminishing is actually just um a product of of the environment as well as the fact that we&amp;#39;re not focusing on tasks in the way that we should in order to to maximize the benefit from them so when you&amp;#39;re trying to learn a new skill in your 40s you obviously have less time to do it you have kids to worry about you probably didn&amp;#39;t sleep very well you know you&amp;#39;re stressed about your job and all these other things and then you say oh I just can&amp;#39;t learn a language like I could when I was a kid but when when you&amp;#39;re a kid you have nothing else to do yeah right you have your French class three times a week and all you&amp;#39;re doing in that class is learning French and you&amp;#39;re dedicating I mean whether or not you enjoy it or you actually paid attention at the time right but you have these focused periods to just work on learning the skill whereas you&amp;#39;re learning French as an adult it&amp;#39;s like well I&amp;#39;ll do 10 minutes of du lingo while I&amp;#39;m s in traffic and then you wonder why you&amp;#39;re not learning French as well as you kill when you&amp;#39;re younger right and some of the right some of these adaptations do slow over time but it&amp;#39;s not that the adult brain can&amp;#39;t do it it&amp;#39;s that we&amp;#39;re not actually applying the principles that we did when we were younger in order to learn these skills today&amp;#39;s episode is sponsored by element element is an electrolyte drink mix that has an ideal electrolyte ratio of sodium potassium and magnesium but no sugar hydration is critical to Performance both physical and mental performance countless Studies have shown that even a slight degree of dehydration even as small as 1% can lead to decreases in physical output and mental performance we also know that electrolytes are critical to proper hydration which I&amp;#39;ve been harping on for years but you can&amp;#39;t do that proper hydration by only drinking water you need to get the right amount of electrolytes in the right ratios and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of element in fact many of you will probably remember that I featured element in my YouTube series on optimizing hydration nearly five years ago I featured element in these videos because their blend of 1,000 milligram of sodium 200 Mig potassium and 60 Mig of magnesium really is unique and different than any other electrolyte on the market and it has great scientific support I use element constantly particularly when I&amp;#39;m sweating a lot and I routinely make it a part of my client&amp;#39;s optimization programs if you&amp;#39;d like to try element you can go to drink LM nt.com perform to claim a free element sample pack with the purches of any element drink mix again that&amp;#39;s drink LM nt.com perform to claim a free sample pack okay so making sure that we are trying to focus on singular tasks at a time and having potentially a little bit of a buffer when we switch from one to the next in terms of expectations right we&amp;#39;re not going to be on the next one quickly so if we go to our our 40 year old and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re back on this Avatar he&amp;#39;s saying okay I just kind of want to enhance my brain function there we get we got uh I drug us off track there pretty quick so kind of coming back to that what would be again your your recommendations of things to think about stuff that he could generally try um you mentioned learning a new language dualingo are there any other specific uh brain training things um do those things work I guess we&amp;#39;ll even start there nutrition supplement ation neut Tropics like what are things we can do um in that again I&amp;#39;m not diseased I&amp;#39;m not hurting we&amp;#39;ll get to that later just feeling pretty good yeah what can I do to make my brain skains I think most brain training as it currently exists is probably not enough for us to see significant far transfer and again in that person in in that per in that particular avar I think we&amp;#39;re now starting to see a revolution in VR particularly in AR where that might start to change and you have very complex environments that you have to navigate and problem solve within and these are some of the things that the brain thrives on and they&amp;#39;re delivered via the eyes which is one of the you know the primary stimuli that that drives you know neural organization and then you know all the downstream consequences of that so you&amp;#39;re you know compared to looking at puzzles on a computer screen you know having some in-depth You Know audio and visual stimulus in a virtual reality environment is much more similar to the way that we nor that we normally uh develop complex skills um and and you know Drive brain development so I think we&amp;#39;re going to see more and more of that coming online even in you know regular adults and actually in kids and older adults the current technology for say video games when in say a 3D a complex 3D environment it hasn&amp;#39;t necessarily there&amp;#39;s been a bit in VR so far research I think that&amp;#39;s going to really explode over the next few years with like all the devices that are now available but even like I think the the game that has the most research is Super Mario World 3D and people who play Super Mario World 3D for a few weeks compared to something like Tetris or solitire see greater improvements in certain standardized cognitive function tests so even that kind of new complex World your um a lot of orientation puzzle solving High effort High Focus yeah and like you&amp;#39;re going to die if you&amp;#39;re not actually paying attention right whereas and probably the same in Tetris but def but not in solitire and actually with increasing complexity you see increasing improvements in cognitive function so providing these complex um you know multi-dimensional and um multi- sensory I think we already have some evidence that that can improve cognitive function in healthy adults and I think we&amp;#39;ll only see see more of that in in the next few years you just gave every sub 50-year-old permission to tell their parents I told you so I told you the video games were okay for me uh Fair characterization or no if cognitive function is low either maybe young or older aging something like a puzzle uming brain training brain HQ is probably the Yeah the more um most studied one many randomized control trials potentially could help however if you are kind of normal to above going past that that&amp;#39;s just not cognitively demanding yeah most likely not right so now you have to get into situations where again you care more or there&amp;#39;s a heart rate elevation there&amp;#39;s some other functional physiological demand that provides enough of a stimuli to cause adaptation so video games of that ill come I&amp;#39;m sure there are plenty of other ones but you get the concept right it has to be all those things you laid out um this is where something like a dance would also then fit in right learning a new skill presumably rock climbing or surfing where your environmental exposures and temperature changes are great activities um Combat Sports are of course are like fantastic for this just don&amp;#39;t get punched in the head too much too much yeah um what about from a nutrition side supplementation side is there anything you can do or on the ver that is there anything that you just have to avoid are there are there particular nutrients or styles of eating that are really bad for the the normal non diseased person or or what do we know about that side outside of energy toxicity which you talked about longterm was a problem yeah so in reality the answer is no there&amp;#39;s nothing that anybody has to avoid there&amp;#39;s some reasonable obser observational epidem epidemiological evidence to say you know highly refined you know diets high in Ultra processed foods which that classification is problematic because it includes protein powder which I would you know happily recommend to people but also Twinkies right I don&amp;#39;t think look we can be pedantic about this but a diet highend you fill in the blank here probably not good yeah ex I don&amp;#39;t know if we have the direct mechanistic research on that for this question but we don&amp;#39;t have to stretch our imaginations far to say there&amp;#39;s so many other reasons why you should avoid that yeah like just okay so outside of that yeah and then that&amp;#39;s a lot of the downstream effects of that are driven either by nutrient deficiencies or energy toxicity right so things that we&amp;#39;ve things that we&amp;#39;ve already covered in terms of supplementation it then probably becomes a case of what is it that you&amp;#39;re trying to achieve and when you&amp;#39;re trying to achieve it so I think in you know healthy individuals in athletes we see some interesting improvements in Co in Broad cognitive function with say creatine supplementation M particularly in in aspects of memory um so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s always high on the list um everything else that I think would would go on the definitely take could also be related to the Nutritional piece so magnesium status vitamin D all those other kinds of things when you&amp;#39;re then thinking about um say supplements or neut Tropics often what you see is that there&amp;#39;s a trade-off that you enhance one function at the the price of another and that&amp;#39;s fine but that has to be a choice you can&amp;#39;t just take these things and think I&amp;#39;m going to be better at everything because the the brain doesn&amp;#39;t work like that well nothing in physiology works like that generally no free passes no free passes no biological free lunch so then um it&amp;#39;s just going to depend on on what you&amp;#39;re trying to achieve so if you&amp;#39;ve um you know had issues with sleep or stress um long term then there are interesting things like theanine ashanda ksm66 they seem to you know improve um stress and also cognitive function in those settings um if you&amp;#39;re thinking about trying to perform in the moment in a given sport uh so I can I can use Formula One as an example we&amp;#39;ve worked with multiple drivers who because of their engineers and the teammate they&amp;#39;re competing against one of one of the metrics that you can easily see they show it on the on on the TV right at the beginning of the races reaction time so how quickly did this driver get off the line when you try and increase that or try and decrease or improve reaction speed decrease reaction time then there are some you know the the the supplement that would first come to mind is caffeine y right no doubt and it works right we know that caffeine improves psychos vigilance and it improves reaction time however we also know that at higher doses caffeine decreases uh complex complex skillability right and decreases certain aspects of EX could imagine any scenario in which you you would want to be driving 200 miles an hour on a th000 milligrams of caffeine yeah absolutely not and so this and but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been done or it&amp;#39;s been tried and you&amp;#39;ll see a great reaction time off the line and then you&amp;#39;re trying to navigate the first corner at 200 mil hour 150 mph with 19 other cars around you and you plow into the first corner so this then comes in into the idea of getting into the right window of arousal for some given cognitive task and we can use supplements to do that um but we can also use um breathing techniques exercise to kind of modulate some of that so there are some supplements and you know depending on the task maybe caffeine is the the right one for most people who who are habitual caffeine users you&amp;#39;re generally just reversing the deficit caused by a caffeine deficiency at the moment rather than enhancing function which is fine you just had coffees before we came in here right um but then beyond that it&amp;#39;s going to really depend on on the task and that&amp;#39;s largely going to be related to arousal what level of arousal is going to be ideal for the task that you&amp;#39;re trying to perform and each task is probably going to have a different uh ideal level of arousal it&amp;#39;s really interesting you say that because with all the athletes we work with there is a spectrum of caffeine use uhuh not only within the person to person that happens but I mean as it categorically between sports if you take for example our NFL players they generally on a pretty high dose of caffeine it&amp;#39;s a cognitive sport but our golfers absolutely not oh yeah like you know maybe a cup in the morning or something like that and that that&amp;#39;s it maybe 50 migs or something like that like some little little top off but they don&amp;#39;t want to have they can&amp;#39;t have that kind of neural control on very much caffeine yeah at all many of them are just no caffeine period right um some of our fighting Sports they can be a little bit of a mix depending on what kind of a they are but they can be on all all kinds of different areas of this I know personally I&amp;#39;m kind of on likee the golf world I generally like like one shot of espresso yeah like that that is like good for the day just like kind of moldering around a little bit if I have afternoon I want like decaf or quarter calf then I&amp;#39;m like that&amp;#39;s like perfect for me um I have other friends who are like the opposite right it&amp;#39;s just like you know six 8 10 servings a day and they&amp;#39;re going if I use almost any form of neut Tropic and I&amp;#39;ve probably tried a dozen outside of caffeine and nicotine I can&amp;#39;t get a word out yeah my cognitive function goes to zero like if if I do like a tenth of a serving like I just I just can&amp;#39;t use it at all but I&amp;#39;d say 90% of the people we&amp;#39;ve coached with Alpha GPC or things like that have a positive experience so Dr Wood why why can I not think straight I mean I I have to think about every word that comes out of my mouth if I do the smallest half dose of alpha GPC that&amp;#39;s a really great question and the answer is I don&amp;#39;t know what the the a lot of people I know really like I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to know this for like a decade by the way the the reason why I can&amp;#39;t answer that question is because there isn&amp;#39;t that much re like high quality research on Alpha GPC there&amp;#39;s quite a lot on CDP Coline or city so another form of Coline which um you know people say that Alpha GPC is more likely to get into the brain more likely to be turned to estaline but there isn&amp;#39;t that much really good quality research so when I talk about Coline supplementation I&amp;#39;ll always fall back on citicoline because that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s much better understood so the reason why I can&amp;#39;t answer your question is because I don&amp;#39;t think anybody&amp;#39;s re to that I anyone that tells me things like Alpha GPC don&amp;#39;t work you make you&amp;#39;re out of your mind you&amp;#39;re out of your mind cuz I I I a quarter a dose I can&amp;#39;t think yeah straight so it absolutely works I guess it depends on your what it means by working how you&amp;#39;re defining sort of work um are there any categorical uh pros and cons to the things so you mentioned one earlier in the example of caffeine you might get enhanced reaction time but perhaps you have a decrease in Focus or attention if it&amp;#39;s over stimulation are there any other General swings like with Alpha GPC or any other ones like we just generally if you get more I don&amp;#39;t know does it even work like that if you get more focused does that then take away creativity or are there any other kind of like big switches that happen like that there&amp;#39;s been as far as I know a lot less research on those different um on those different trade-offs there&amp;#39;s there was a little bit uh historically on some of the the rasams yep um and and showed something similar right you might have an improvement in in some aspect of um executive function or memory but then uh you know verbal fluency or some other aspect of cognitive function decreased in response um the the stimulants broadly have do seem to have that trade-off that we mentioned with caffeine so there&amp;#39;s a recent study that came out and compared caffeine to methylphenidate and some of the other stimulants that are regularly used by students and yeah yeah you know to you when they&amp;#39;re studying or you know the clinical population like ADHD who actually you might might benefit from them and you tend to see something tend to see something similar so you you might improve on one aspect cognitive function but especially certain aspects of executive function seem to decrease what&amp;#39;s interesting is that a lot of um you see this in the uh say the Psychedelic um micro doing literature um you see it in the Cannabis literature people think they&amp;#39;re more creative or they think they have improved cognitive function but actually if you measure it objectively they don&amp;#39;t and it it actually paralleled some of the caffeine research where people you just set the whole internet on fire sorry um and so what what often happens is people think they&amp;#39;re functioning better and this has happened in some caffeine studies as well they think they&amp;#39;re functioning better but actually objectively they&amp;#39;re functioning worse so there&amp;#39;s this decoupling of the subjective and the objective again um and none of this is inherently bad it&amp;#39;s just knowing what it is you&amp;#39;re trying to achieve in the given moment what what is that because you see the same thing in sleep literature if you sleep deprived people not even to extremes 6 hours a night things like that you&amp;#39;ll see routinely cogn function decreases like massively with almost not always but a lot of times no subjective change yeah so people think I&amp;#39;m totally fine I&amp;#39;m totally fine I&amp;#39;m totally fine and then on a standardized test they&amp;#39;re hot garbage like what what&amp;#39;s actually happening that makes you feel like here is it just the acute self-preservation something must be going on here that is catastrophic or important so we&amp;#39;re going to maintain like total short-term focus and just disregard like the real world like what is happening here it&amp;#39;s funny because you often see the opposite in sleep literature which is where you know like Ellen Langer&amp;#39;s work where they randomized people to sleep for8 hours but they told them they slept for 5 hours right so they slept a perfect amount and but they thought I didn&amp;#39;t sleep well therefore I&amp;#39;m not going to perform well and they and they don&amp;#39;t perform well because they because they have this expectation so I think for for some of it there&amp;#39;s there is this aspect aspect of what do you expect to happen and thoughts Drive physiology like we know that&amp;#39;s the case but and there&amp;#39;s ton you we can do that across blood sugar control um sleep um even how physical activity affects mortality we&amp;#39;ve done it with lifting weights mhm we we actually put different numbers on the barbell we ran a couple of these random uh of uh deception studies yeah with it yeah like you will definitely PR yeah if you think the bar is 15 pounds lighter than it is you will absolutely PR they&amp;#39;ve done it with the anabolic steroids right that was the one of the most famous ones yeah that what a one yeah so some of it is just purely driven by expectation and I think this translates into everything in terms of how we think about our cognitive function is like what are we expecting from ourselves today and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because our thoughts Drive our physiology and then you get the result that you expect but sometimes like you said you in in in the opposite scenario where you haven&amp;#39;t slept well you think you&amp;#39;re fine and you can still measure um and you know an objective decrease in function there is still some like Baseline requirement that we have these things in place for cognitive function so some of it&amp;#39;s driven by expectation but expectation isn&amp;#39;t going to be enough to overcome right really significant defit yeah and we saw this a ton at Absolute rest initially and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in in various aspects where set and setting and habit override most small effect yeah in other words if you wake up in the morning and you brew coffee and then you walk your and you do the whole routine and then you sit down on your computer and then you start writing then that is going to have a massive neut Tropic effect not necessarily simply because of the caffeine in that particular case but because your brain body knows the pattern of when we get down here this is when we do our deep work right so if one day you got switched out something else there you would not have as much of a problem as you would maybe if the setting is Switched right so this it&amp;#39;s not that the caffeine deer didn&amp;#39;t work it&amp;#39;s the whole set and setting that brings the experience from a sleep perspec Ive if you have a certain habit a certain behavior that then promotes quality sleep or does the opposite that&amp;#39;s the pattern that you&amp;#39;ll see right so you can try all the sleep supplements you want it&amp;#39;s not going to matter if you have this chaotic yeah like sleep routine right so you&amp;#39;re not saying that those things aren&amp;#39;t doing anything it&amp;#39;s just that the benefit is potentially only going to be seen if the rest of the situation is captured yeah and clear because there&amp;#39;s just too much noise in that overall system and that makes a ton of sense um from me um we&amp;#39;ve mentioned this stuff a couple of times but I want to go back just a little bit to our Avatar let&amp;#39;s say that person&amp;#39;s good we did as much as we could on him but now let&amp;#39;s say he or she is saying okay I&amp;#39;m not normal cognitive function I don&amp;#39;t think I have brain disease it&amp;#39;s brain fog right I&amp;#39;m just and it&amp;#39;s not perceptive it is noticeable it is real there&amp;#39;s this big decline um you hear a lot of these certainly the last couple years about potentially long Co I happened when I after I got Co or didn&amp;#39;t or got a whatever just for whatever reason we&amp;#39;re down there how does somebody know what that actually is uh how are there tests that you can take are there online surveys or things that the average person could try and then secondly you know get what do I do to improve that this is another controversial area the idea of brain fog which I kind of use interchangeably with the more formal definition which is subjective cognitive decline that&amp;#39;s brain fogs way nicer sound so when when you look at the um the sort of the stages of dementia now they they include some of these some of these periods so first you know everything&amp;#39;s good no subjective or objective change and then next there&amp;#39;s probably a subjective decline before you see an objective change in function right or at least that&amp;#39;s assuming that you don&amp;#39;t have years of longitudinal cognitive function test in this person which nobody has so if you you feel like I have this brain fog I feel like something&amp;#39;s not quite right but if I gave you a bunch of standardized cognitive function tests you&amp;#39;d be within the normal range and I&amp;#39;d say there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with you right but there&amp;#39;s quite a lot of research now suggesting that that subjective decline which you know has a lot of overlap with the idea of brain fog then is a associated with improve improve or increased risk of first M cognitive impairment which is like the next step of cognitive decline and then dementia obviously not everybody who gets brain fog is going to get dementia right I don&amp;#39;t want to say that right now you just terrified the internet you set them on fire earlier now they&amp;#39;re all terrified that and and that so that is definitely not true it&amp;#39;s but I think the fact that they are linked at least at the population level statistically suggests that that could be a signal of some kind of impending issue or the beginnings of initial of of an initial issue now most of that in that in that stage is thought to be reversible even if you ask you know Dusty old neurologists who think about who thought about this they would tell you and that if you look at the this the sort of the spectrum that&amp;#39;s in published papers they&amp;#39;ll say that at this stage it&amp;#39;s reversible so then you have to think about well what are the potential contributors to this and there are just the same old Basics that are going to come up again and again and again and so we we already covered the nutrition stuff that is that like you said you&amp;#39;ve even seen that um in your own clients right you address some basic nutritional things and a lot of this stuff lifts immediately I&amp;#39;d probably say 60% of our clients have a subjective score of of cognitive function of five or less out of 10 yeah right so whether they actually have brain for don&amp;#39;t like over half of our people think that their brain is functioning poorly yeah and I would say our success rate is over 90% with all that yeah we&amp;#39;ve done lot sometimes it is more complicated but a lot of the times if you cover all the bases we have stunningly High results and that makes perfect sense if you think about or if you think about the the framework of how I think about cognitive function and so maybe that&amp;#39;s this is the time to kind of bring that um and because it then relates to long-term cognitive decline as well so to kind of fit all these different pieces together we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve touched on a lot of them I have what I call now the 3s model which is stimulus Supply and support and these are the three broad categories of the things that are required to maintain and sustain cognitive function and some inputs will cover many of those at the same time right so they like sometimes i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve put up a picture in a lecture and said here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s my model and somebody&amp;#39;s like yes but something goes there and there I&amp;#39;m like yeah I know but pict yeah it&amp;#39;s just a picture right just kind of simplify it but we&amp;#39;ve talked about stimulus and I think that&amp;#39;s the primary driver of a lot of cognitive function but in order to respond to stimulus we need a few things so in the supply bucket we have um good cardiovascular function right um what you see in the brain when you have an increase in activity in some Network associated with some function is you see an increase in blood flow and direction of resources to the area of the brain um this is the process of neur vascular coupling right so when neurons become active blood vessels in in that area dilate we D we direct um resources to that area this requires a healthy vascular system right and so as it&amp;#39;s almost exactly the same process of as what happens in the coronary arteries in the heart as we get into the process of heart disease and therefore there&amp;#39;s a lot of overlap in risk factors for heart disease and risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline probably because of that vascular component so everything that would improve cardiovascular heal Health then helps to support this exercise being one but obviously other aspects of maintain you know making sure you have low cardiovascular risk blood pressure you know lipids if necessary all those kinds of things then you need some kind of energy source right for most parts of the brain most of the time it&amp;#39;s going to be glucose uh but it certainly could be lactate it could be ketones right so and they need to get there and they need to be able to get to get to get across and that that&amp;#39;s where some of the energy toxicity piece comes into play um and then you need nutrients to build and maintain the structures of the brain and we&amp;#39;ve talked about Omega-3s and B vitamins being critical components so that&amp;#39;s kind of that&amp;#39;s the supply part right if you want to actually create a response to a stimulus you need all of those things in place then you the support side is a few things one is are you allowing the opportunity for the brain to respond to stimulus and again to return to our uh gym analogy everybody knows you don&amp;#39;t get bigger in the gym you get bigger when you rest right and the brain is exactly the same so sleep being critical to that um an absence of chronic uncontrolled or uncontrollable stresses is a big Point as well and when I&amp;#39;ve like tried we&amp;#39;re currently writing a paper that sort of like lays out this in a in a more Academic Way um s like a approach to cognitive function and when you talk about stress in the support side even sort of like other neuroscientists in the field of people get a little bit um uncertain about that because when you look at stress and what it does to the brain in many senses it is a cognitive demand it creates like neuronal hyper metabolism so you almost have to think about it as overtraining right so it&amp;#39;s preventing the ability right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s junk volume for your brain it&amp;#39;s preventing the ability to to to adapt so that&amp;#39;s part of it and then you also want to avoid um any kind of uh exposures that prevent some of these adaptations from happening so Al you know excessive alcohol smoking you know air pollution is really common um and so if you&amp;#39;re trying to address brain fong in an individual these are all the areas that you have to think about right you have to think about um energy metabolism vascular health um sleep stress other exposures uh we already talked about nutrient status and there you know some other things that can inhibit this process include chronic chronic inflammation so that&amp;#39;s where I think long covid starts to come into play and we know that you can see chronic inflammatory processes in the brain you know in certain individuals who have um ongoing symptoms after covid you see the same thing often years or decades after certain traumatic brain injuries and the amount of residual inflammation that you have in the brain um relates to then cognitive function or cognitive deficits in that individual how you address that becomes tricky but that&amp;#39;s also not going to be necessarily relevant to the vast majority of people who might be experiencing these things so that framework I think gives you then a chance to say well where is the is the likely deficit or where is the issue that we&amp;#39;re most likely to F you know going to see benefit and why it&amp;#39;s also important I think to think about it in that kind of framework is that these risks and components aren&amp;#39;t linear like when we when we talk about risk factors for cognitive decline or cognitive issues you just get a list of 12 some people it&amp;#39;s 50 risk factors and they talk about it as if you have to hit all of them perfectly in order to see improvements in cognitive function and that&amp;#39;s actually not true they interact and they synergize so we know that if you have high blood pressure uh you offset some of that risk if you sleep better and if but if you don&amp;#39;t sleep well you&amp;#39;ll offset some of that risk if you do exercise so you don&amp;#39;t have to perfectly hit everything in order to like plug all the holes in the roof which is one of the analogies that&amp;#39;s kind of used for these processes actually you can pull a few levers a little bit and you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll then almost see or often see outsid benefits so before we transition to this next area if I had to summarize if I feel like my cognitive function is fine I&amp;#39;m not having any deficit right now now but I wanted to improve it then searching for novel tasks mhm is probably the way to go ideally ones that have multiple sensory inputs so smell memory different forms of cognitive function creativity U executive function like different aspects now will task of there and avoid ex you know extended or continuous task switching because we know that&amp;#39;s a significant stressor that&amp;#39;s going to be very relevant to the Avatar that you% yep thank you for that if on the opposite where I feel like I have some sort of cognitive dysfunction I&amp;#39;ve lost it then we go after the 3s model and we figure out presumably where in the where area of that I&amp;#39;m struggling the most with so is it the the supply area is it um the other ones so yes so Supply and support or it could still be stimulus right or stimulus right so maybe I&amp;#39;m not doing enough different things maybe there&amp;#39;s some hole somewhere so more than likely you&amp;#39;ve got a hole in your game somewhere yeah that&amp;#39;s either then causing excessive energy you feel like your energy is low but what&amp;#39;s actually happening is you&amp;#39;re burning a lot of energy you don&amp;#39;t really realize it because your stress load is high yeah and that&amp;#39;s actually literally burning fuel in your brain right to keep that managed um I would say of the people I&amp;#39;m talking about that we coach at r that has that 90% um I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ve seen anybody that has a problem outside of that yeah oftentimes they think that they are for sure convinced that there&amp;#39;s something off the- wall going on and that has occasionally happen but most of the time I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not simply saying the basics most of the time if we do a full true analysis of sleep Stress Management movement daily uh format so how your actual life is structured hydration and um Mental Health on top of nutrition blood work things like that something is generally very very bad yeah and they may not see that perceive that but once we get that cleaned up sometimes it&amp;#39;s been as simple honestly as hydration yeah that&amp;#39;s that um I didn&amp;#39;t mention that but would you know fits right into that supply side right stunning a CR a critical component sometimes it&amp;#39;s low sometimes it&amp;#39;s high I&amp;#39;ve talked about this so many times now but particularly females they just stress drink water they just chug it and we&amp;#39;re like you can&amp;#39;t drink two gallons of water a day I&amp;#39;m being a little bit hyperbolic but not much there and you lower that back to normal and like headaches go away function comes comes back and you&amp;#39;re like oh I feel smart again so th those are I think really insightful things that we can do mhm today&amp;#39;s episode is sponsored by Renaissance periodization if you want to put

again that&amp;#39;s rpst strength.com perform to save up to $50 off of your subscription last little thing I want I want to ask about before we move forward to something you&amp;#39;ve kind of been alluding to but that is Vision training you mentioned reaction time and I&amp;#39;m bringing this up because we see this actually a lot with our athletes and people tend to not realize it the first time I caught wi to this was actually a number of years ago working with high level major league baseball players there&amp;#39;s some actually some cool work out of Japan it found that the variance in major league baseball players the batting success so batting average it was something absurd like 70% of varians was all in visual like auar metrics explained almost everything and that&amp;#39;s when I was like whoa if we really think we&amp;#39;re going to service our baseball players better if we&amp;#39;re not touching and testing and monitoring and improving Vision like we&amp;#39;re spit we&amp;#39;re going after pennies yeah on the dollar here so what do we know about testing Vision outside of of course you need glasses like things like that and then like can I get that tested how do I get that tested and then what do I do to improve it if I can&amp;#39;t test and just again are there exercise are there breath work are there nutrition how do we improve Vision supplements whatever the case may be recently we&amp;#39;ve done some work um also in Formula 1 drivers with vision because this is a big part of their um a part of their job and it&amp;#39;s essential they&amp;#39;ll probably you start to lose some visual accurity before you&amp;#39;re going to lose a lot of other functions the eyes are an extension of the brain essentially so a lot of the stuff that we just talked about actually applies here as well um really so that basic stuff should improve Vision as well yeah and I did some analyses with some large population data sets um in order to try and answer some of this question of course it&amp;#39;s in a general population but if you&amp;#39;re looking at different aspects of visual Acuity even just measured with like a a standard test you&amp;#39;ll see that blood sugar control nutrient status all of these things also you know smoking and all that kind of stuff all those same risk factors that we know are important for cognitive function they then relate to to visual Acuity as well so those same principles come into play and all those same nutrients are going to be important as well because you you&amp;#39;re essentially firing neurons from the eye into the brain right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the same process when you then think about uh visual assessment um there are a whole bunch of different platforms that you can do do this with depending on you know how much money you have and what you have access to but like right ey is is one that&amp;#39;s you know fairly good certainly looks at different aspects of eye tracking which is important um for athletes but also after concussions and things like that you can also do much more complex um eye Imaging like Optimal tomography they can give you a much better idea of the the the structure of the eye itself and if there&amp;#39;s any potential issues there when you then think about visual training a lot of it comes down to similar principles and actually there&amp;#39;s a big overlap between um your visual training and both physical and cognitive training because part of it is neurological and part of it is physical right you are training muscles in the eye so when we start to lose visual Acuity you can in reverse that with essentially Progressive overload of um the ocular muscles by just trying to focus on something that&amp;#39;s just beyond the the reach of your of your current visual Acuity similarly if say it&amp;#39;s like dark light contrast is the same we spend a lot of time exposed to the same um intensity of light indoors um and so then we that may be part of the reason why we lose some um dark light contrast as we get older there&amp;#39;s a nutritional piece as well but like how often do we see and try and see in true dark and how often do we see in bright light and it&amp;#39;s not that often because we&amp;#39;re not exposing us ourselves to those differences um in in light levels so you can then do um training with like visual tracking so when I was trying to put together a program uh to for for say a Formula One driver that that that want to try and maintain visual tracking there are some off the-shelf things that you can use there&amp;#39;s some nice evidence for something like neurot tracker um where you do multiple object tracking um that&amp;#39;s probably not nearly as complex as you would need to do when driving a Formula 1 car but for somebody who&amp;#39;s done no visual training there&amp;#39;s some reasonable evidence to say that multiple object tracking just on your computer can improve some aspects of of vision and then beyond that it&amp;#39;s just thinking how do you create more and more complex situations where you you then train these muscles so um I spoke to a friend of mine who&amp;#39;s uh a former Special Forces and does a lot of this kind of training with individuals and so one of his favorite uh tasks is to use a baseball that you hang on some kind of string and then you have um either letters or some kind of symbols on it so then you can first start with uh the ball just hanging still and vertical and then you can practice say focusing on the far distance focusing on uh a symbol on the ball then focusing even closer right so you can practice uh quickly switching visual depth but then you can also do things like make the pendulum swing and then you have to track you know a certain symbol as the ball rotates and then also do that by Chang by quickly changing visual fields and so then you&amp;#39;re essentially TR um training all these different parameters of vision both visual field as well as um you know looking all the different directions that you might choose to look so the extremes of peripheral vision and as well as up upgaze and DOW gaze and it seems that right you probably can&amp;#39;t overcome a huge visual deficit right but a lot of these different uh features of vision do seem to be trainable there&amp;#39;s a old thing we used to do in baseball where you have a bucket of balls and you throw balls to a hitter and the hitter has to identify ify different numbers and letters right so you&amp;#39;re going imagine you got a bucket of balls there and you got a one on one of the balls the next ball has a B on it and so like that and you throw it in the batter and only has to hit the ball but then say that was four that was F things like that yeah are you telling me that that might plausibly actually work yes you Vindicated every 1980s basball hitting coach normal normally it&amp;#39;s like some of these uh old school training methods just seem like hazing and uh they kind of these attritional processes but some of it might actually work okay so could do things like that we see this a lot of the times in Combat Sports and stuff as well we throw different numbers out there I think what you said at the beginning then makes a ton of sense this is it&amp;#39;s the same exact principles of training your muscle which were the same as training your physical brain yeah and now you&amp;#39;re eye right it is Progressive overload it is stimuli it is changing things is a variety and then it is intention and focus so you couple those things together you could probably come up with just about any drill yeah you really wanted it like doesn&amp;#39;t matter a whole heck of a lot um vitamin A keratin like what what about things like this it makes sense if you Wikipedia really quickly what those things are um for clearly there&amp;#39;s evidence if you&amp;#39;ve got certain physical cognitive or physical issues in your eye especially from like a vitamin A deficiency yeah then of course it&amp;#39;s going to work but for the normal person and the reason I&amp;#39;m asking this is I know of multiple companies now that sell very specific very expensive supplements for vision yeah for normal vision to enhanced vision for Special Forces for certain sporting populations I know you don&amp;#39;t know the data on all these I don&amp;#39;t even know them but in general is it plausible that they work is it completely implausible or do we not know so a lot of supplements that we use to boost any function or are used to boost any function like testosterone boosters or these kind of visual boosters they there&amp;#39;s probably going to be a benefit in the setting of an insufficiency or deficiency but then increasing above that you&amp;#39;re not you you&amp;#39;re not going to see um any benefit for some people um right retinol is important we know retinol is important in the eye some people du to genetic polymorphism aren&amp;#39;t as good at converting be kosene into retinol right so maybe there&amp;#39;s some indiv inter individual variability there but no like more isn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t going to be better um certainly other things do seem to suggest some benefit and it&amp;#39;s kind of like squint a bit and and it might help but some of the antioxidants you know lutein asanin zanthin they seem to be associated with improvements in cognitive function and sometimes a supplement there were trials that show some of those supplements can improve V visual Accu and some other aspects of vision yeah actually that&amp;#39;s like reasonably well demonstrated at this point my ass my question with those trials are always are you simply seeing a metric of somebody who had suboptimal physiology oh I&amp;#39;m sure yeah probably in most scenarios because we know that most people have some nutritional requirement or you know metabolic health issue or something like that so then if you&amp;#39;re you have a bunch of oxitive stress in your eye because you&amp;#39;re pre-diabetic then you know uh uh an antioxidant then can that can get into that system is likely to show benefit yeah right um which is not to say you shouldn&amp;#39;t use it yeah right if this is your first entry into enhancement for that individual as a coaching tool that that happens right sometimes you struggle with people and you&amp;#39;re like you know what I&amp;#39;m just going to give them an easy win because we&amp;#39;ve been trying the nutrition we&amp;#39;ve been trying to not get get to stop drinking as much as they won&amp;#39;t but then they see benefit there so I actually don&amp;#39;t want to dismay that too much um we take a different approach of course generally and so we haven&amp;#39;t really seen much benefit yeah in those folks but I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not surprised by that so you&amp;#39;ve mentioned this multiple times now whether it be from the energy toxicity or your uh metabolic and energy sustained principles with cognitive function but I&amp;#39;m wondering like how specifically things like PR actually enhance brain function we you can take this actually from both angles this is like actual cognitive function first of all does it like if I take [ __ ] right now am I going to have a Improvement in cognitive function and then what about long-term brain as well so kind of two-part question there about creatine specific I guess we&amp;#39;ll just start there yeah and then how actually it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s doing those if it is at all so whether you would see a significant benefit from creatine right now probably depends a littleit you take your dose of 10 G RS and like what are you going to see uh it probably depends a little bit on your context but you you probably saw the recent paper that showed that after one night of sleep deprivation you know creatine can overcome some of those deficits cognitively cognitively yeah and that&amp;#39;s like that was actually shown um a few years ago uh with skill rugby skills in rugby players you may have seen that paper as well where they had players after a period of sleep deprivation they gave them either creatine or caffeine and saw similar improvements in uh like rugby specific skills compared to a placebo yeah with a very different mechanism here right you&amp;#39;re talking about a stimulant and versus a fuel right totally opposite yeah so uh however you could probably relate both of those to energetics in some way because caffeine is overcoming or it&amp;#39;s inhibiting the metabolic downregulation caused by adenosine um which is part of what drives you know sleep pressure in the need for sleep as you accumulate metabolites like adenosine they then um sort of suppress metabolic activity in the brain um which then is associated with reduced function and something like caffeine overcomes that whereas creatine can acutely uh provide a buffer uh an energetic buffer that allows you to maintain function in the face of um sort of increasing metabolic pressure to to sleep so even though different mechanisms they kind of maybe converge on on something similar I know a lot of people who you know every time they take creatin they notice like an immediate sort of boost of some kind cognitive function yeah um and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s been a lot of discussion over the years about whether creatine negatively impacts sleep um for that reason it&amp;#39;s sort of it&amp;#39;s slightly stimulating for some people um I&amp;#39;ve certainly found that in myself like if I take c i I work out in the afternoon if I take creatine after my workouts I don&amp;#39;t sleep as well but if I take it first thing in the morning it&amp;#39;s fine because I&amp;#39;ve kind of separated it away and not everybody&amp;#39;s like that and certainly we know that uh responses to creatine are very hetrogeneous right some people see totally big uh big responses some people see see smaller responses and some of it may be related to methylation status because creatine uh when we make our own which we make a lot of is the most methylation intensive process in the body you spend Mo like more of your methal groups producing creatine than anything else um and so it could be related to that as well as you know a whole host of you know how much creatine do you normally have in your diet and and things like that so if I&amp;#39;ve gotten genetic testing done and I&amp;#39;m a no no don&amp;#39;t do it sh don&amp;#39;t go there okay so I think based on your reaction maybe have just give us a a little bit of an insight into your fever favor favor there so um whenever whenever somebody talks about methylation they immediately start talking about genetic testing and there&amp;#39;s a lot of that out there right now yes genetic polymorphisms do uh change the functional level of enzymes related to methylation the one that people talk about the most is MTHFR um different um you different polymorphisms within uh MTHFR change the activity of that enzyme you know in a test tube right if I take right in theory and then they do in some ways relate to other markers of methylation so um cine we mentioned briefly earlier is is a is a is an important marker for you know risk factor of a wide variety of diseases it&amp;#39;s directly related um to your current methylation status um but in most cases an elevation of homocysteine related to those PO polymorphisms is driven by some kind of nutrient deficiency or insufficiency sometimes your requirement is slightly higher because of a polymorphism but in general I have yet to see a study that would change my mind when I say I can tell everything I need to tell from a blood test I can tell from your phenotype and there&amp;#39;s no additional information that I get from your genotype whereas the opposite is not true if I just measure your genetics I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on with you and I still need to measure your your your your B vitamin levels and your B vitamin status your methylation status so for most people measuring those polymorphisms is not helpful but what it does is it drives a huge out of fear cuz people are like I&amp;#39;m a poor methylator like what does that even mean like you&amp;#39;re continuously methylating right you if you&amp;#39;re if you don&amp;#39;t methylate you die right you can&amp;#39;t turn genes on and off you literally can&amp;#39;t do anything so we create this massive nobo around uh these different polymorphisms which I think is is net harmful when yes sometimes this is an issue but if you have a significant um decrease in MTHFR function like in air quotes um related to an MTHFR polymorphism all you have to do to see a significant reduction in SE homosysteine is make sure that you&amp;#39;re eating the recommended daily allowance of riboflavin like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not hard it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s literally nothing and that&amp;#39;s because the polymorphisms change how MTHFR bind to fad which is the the proton carrier that that enzyme uses so all you need to do is slightly increase availability of riboflavin to be converted into fad and that&amp;#39;s it and it doesn&amp;#39;t require super dooses just literally just 2 milligrams a day it&amp;#39;s nothing there&amp;#39;s also a very low relationship between those polymorphisms and actual homoy oh yeah like very sub 1% so I&amp;#39;ve yeah and I&amp;#39;ve published a paper on that actually for that exact reason I I I did these uh big simulation studies looking at the the normal distribution of homosysteine by MTHFR polymorphism from published data and essentially about 1% of your homosysteine is predicted by by your level of activity of your MTHFR enzy yeah so why not just measure the homo I did a whole episode on genetic testing in season one so please feel free to go back and listen to that if you want um so we we&amp;#39;ll move on for now because we can get aggressive there but I I think what potentially is interesting here is say somebody has done that testing so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter they&amp;#39;ve already paid the money they&amp;#39;re in so you know tough luck and potentially they&amp;#39;ve had or think or or are actually low with methylation status would that person then potentially be more likely to be a hyper responder to [ __ ] for that exact reason or would that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve hypothesized but I and maybe this studies if this study has been done somebody sent it to me because I&amp;#39;d love to see it but I I think that might be the case that would make sense because so much um like so much of your methylation currency is spent on creating production if you know you have to decrease some of that production because you know you&amp;#39;re quote unquote a poor methylator or you have poor methylation status poor B vitamin status then it would make sense that you would sacrifice some creatine production um and then would respond better to creatine supplementation uh but so in theory yes but I don&amp;#39;t think anybody&amp;#39;s actually looked at that I wonder if it works the opposite way then as well so somebody who&amp;#39;s had potentially uh it will exclude Placebo which is a large P portion of this but uh people that have had had some sort of genetic testing done then gone on high doses of B vitamins and felt a massive response I wonder if those people could also then simply just go to [ __ ] instead yeah which is I won&amp;#39;t say safer but a little bit less uh risky right um not a lot of downside to [ __ ] not a lot of downside to B vitamins but more MH like you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re going to get other consequences that you maybe didn&amp;#39;t realize you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re going after with high doses of depending on which vitamin vitamin B you go after um but less potential downsides yeah I would think you can go after what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s interesting is that unfortunately these kind of questions haven&amp;#39;t really been addressed in the literature right so I I can quote studies on supplementing with B vitamins in individuals with elevated homosysteine and right we know we know how that can be important and but then we can also talk about studies where they give doses of creatine and particularly when you&amp;#39;ve start particularly in older populations and those who Maybe started to see some element of cognitive deine you see a greater effect size of supplementing with creatine but I don&amp;#39;t think anybody&amp;#39;s looked at like what if you gave one or the other or is there a trade-off um these are like super interesting and important questions but because of the the sort of the reductionist evidence-based medicine model that we currently have we just like try one thing at a time and don&amp;#39;t necessarily consider the context around it I vitamin B is I&amp;#39;m all four that&amp;#39;s great I just know that a reasonably high percentage of people will get really nauseous or have GI distress from them and so for those folks potentially maybe creatine is a little bit of an alternative option if you think you have a mulation or actually do either way and B vitamins don&amp;#39;t sit well with you yeah especially that dosage and maybe creatine gives you some percentage of that benefit as well certainly we&amp;#39;ve done um you know so you know when I was working with a lot of individuals in you know in a similar Arena to to what you do now um you this is taking get you people with their blood work and providing individualized protocols this is what you&amp;#39;ve done for a very very long time yeah and when and this is sort of like general population as well as with athletes and if um you know B vitamin status looked okay but maybe hyem was still elevated or you know you we needed other strategies to help bring down homosysteine then creatine and choline um or lethin which is a you know a plant a plant derived um source of phosph choline um they they were were good alternative options or something you could add on top yeah okay why then does creatin help with cognitive function if it does and we&amp;#39;ll get back to that second part of that two-part question um is it the methylation support that it&amp;#39;s giving you is there other mechanisms what exactly is greetin doing for the brain I think one one of the things that I found most interesting across strategies that seem to improve like robustly improve cognitive function um either across the lifespan or in multiple different groups is that they usually do more than one thing and anytime we&amp;#39;ve tried something that only does one thing it doesn&amp;#39;t work yeah that&amp;#39;s just like a lesson from Neuroscience in general and also a lot of um uh just like developing drugs in in medicine in general yeah um and so I think it&amp;#39;s probably going to be a bit of all these things so uh we know that that home assisting is a risk factor for congressive decline um and that&amp;#39;s probably because it&amp;#39;s a marker of methylation status right so are you able to uh generate say membranes in in cells in the brain like we talked about earlier but equally uh homocystine can directly increase the accumulation of hyper phosphorated tow which is one of the sort of markers of you know risk factors of dementia it&amp;#39;s a marker of you know previous brain trauma and a number of other things so it may contribute to cognitive decline in a number of ways and so if creatine is offsetting some of that issue you may have some benefit there then there&amp;#39;s the energetic piece right it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to give you shortterm short-term energetic buffer as phosphocreatine um in neuronal cells and the brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body on like a uh you know calories per or watts per gram um comparison and so you know anytime you have either a suppression of metabolism say uh you know adenosine or some kind of acute injury uh and that can either be it could be a stroke it could be Cardiac Arrest it could be brain trauma where you have um some kind of deficit in energy production then creatine also seems to potentially be beneficial although um some of the studies suggest you can supplement afterwards but most of the benefit seems to be if it&amp;#39;s on board beforehand and of course a lot of this evidence comes from from animal models because you can&amp;#39;t do that you know easily in in humans so some of it is an energetic buffer and then some of it um you know one thing that creatine seems to do is to help stabilize and regulate calcium handling in mitochondria um which is related to acute injuries but also to to long-term um mitochondrial function which then supports long-term um cell function in the brain really quickly I don&amp;#39;t want to drag this down too far but you&amp;#39;ve mentioned it multiple times what is methylation so why does it matter and just real quick on this yeah so methylation is basically the the transfer of methal groups which is BAS a one carbon group or a carbon with uh three hydrogens that gets moved around and uh this is used to uh convert different metabolites um in in in the body in like multiple different stellular reactions like you you change a a molecule from one end to another by methylating it but it&amp;#39;s also really important for things like um Gene regulation so people might have heard of biological age epigenetics the major um form of epigenetics and uh Gene regulation and you know the the sort of the more common measures of epigenetic biological age all are all based on methylation status so you have uh these what called cpg Islands on DNA which is where essentially the cell puts on these methylation tags which regulates whether a gene is turned on and off and these um these tags seem to shift over over time that&amp;#39;s associated with bi biological aging so it&amp;#39;s this really Central process that drives you know so many different parts of biology it&amp;#39;s in every cell yeah of your body it&amp;#39;s on DNA it&amp;#39;s on protein it&amp;#39;s moving a carbon is hard yeah like chemically right so it&amp;#39;s got to be a major thing to get it to move off of one which changes the entire function yeah mole so it&amp;#39;s I think the way that you st it is very nice it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a core biological thing uh you don&amp;#39;t adapt you don&amp;#39;t grow you don&amp;#39;t shrink you don&amp;#39;t go any direction without mulation so thank you for that now we have a little bit of understanding of why that&amp;#39;s important um then regarding the [ __ ] in the brain the second part you said was fueling MH all right walk me through how creatin actually you mentioned it kind of quickly uh with just a touch of jargon there which yeah uh for the folks that don&amp;#39;t know what an intermediate and a substrate are yeah how is creatine actually providing fuel for your brain um and then on the second part of that is what&amp;#39;s the normal fuel yeah for our brain when you think about uh different Energy Systems and I think people could uh watch endless lectures from you talking about different Energy Systems in in uh in exercise and those principles in some ways are very similar um in the brain although the majority of cells in the brain are you know like like we said earlier derived uh derive energy from glucose goes through glycolysis then enters the electron you know the pyrovate and or lact Pate goes into the electone transport chain in the mitochondria but there&amp;#39;s all of that is done to generate high energy phosphates VI usually or mainly ATP right so ATP is your energy currency sort of a much shorter term um energy currency or that allows you to recycle ATP when you&amp;#39;ve used it up is the phosphocreatine system so um your creatine is phosphorated with a high energy phosphate and you use that to regenerate ATP so for very energetically expensive uh processes where you can&amp;#39;t get enough energy through that longer process that glycolysis and aerobic metabolism then the buffer comes from the fossil creatine system and it seems that even for normal cognitive function um there is some benefit from having more of that buffer on board um uh both acutely and and chronically so just like your muscles yeah or any other part of your system they have to rely on energy the nerves need energy to conduct right and so people I guess sometimes don&amp;#39;t always grasp the fact that you&amp;#39;re brain when we say it&amp;#39;s energetically demanding it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s going through a ton of metabolism we have this connotation that muscle and Metabolism yeah kind of thing but the brain is metabolism yeah as well your basil metabolic rate the amount of energy you burn throughout the day you&amp;#39;re fast or slow metabolism all these things are it&amp;#39;s in your brain yeah as well and so it produces energy much like anything else it can use fat as a fuel source theoretically it can use carbohydrates it could use ketones or anything else and then creatine uh just like it is in your muscle provides that stochiometry of of one to one right so not a lot of energy per molecule of creatine so it gets used up and turned and burned quickly but the upside is it gives you that energy really fast and so while you&amp;#39;re maybe slow to metabolize and you mentioned this so I&amp;#39;ll bring it up your brain will actually then generate lactate yeah so if you&amp;#39;re thinking really hard and thinking a long time are you like feeling the burn in your brain is that lactate building up is that what happening I don&amp;#39;t think uh lactate doesn&amp;#39;t accumulate it just gets generated and and used you probably couldn&amp;#39;t um you you could you could probably measure um so so this is where I think creatin becomes important and and you potentially if if I put micro dialysis needles really you know accurately in certain parts of the brain and then you you start to upregulate the use of that Network for a specific function because there&amp;#39;s going to be a slight delay between increased ATP production um and the requirement right you need you you actually need that energy before you realize you need it right everything that we see and do has essentially already happened because of the time lag that it takes for us to actually interpret the those actions so that energy is needed immediately and it could be that because of the lag in the system you know upregulating uh energy production that&amp;#39;s where creating becomes important in in in a network as you activate it then you would probably start to see uh locally if you could meas you know measure it with say carbon 13 metabolism or something like you could have a radio tracer on your on your lactate and you could see that your asites which make your lactate for your neurons um will probably increase production because your neurons are more active in that area they&amp;#39;re going to require more energy they&amp;#39;ve used up their phosphocreatine system and then the asites locally are going to produce more lactate none of it&amp;#39;s going to accumulate because it&amp;#39;s getting used but flux through the system is probably increasing and this is potentially why people have looked a lot at lactate as a supplement or as a medication or therapy for various aspects of a brain injury and uh brain damage I don&amp;#39;t want to go to this into too much detail because I covered a whole episode in season one episode 10 uh all on a paper that that you led with Dr Federica conti and myself and some other folks as well on what we know exactly regarding supplementation and nutrition for brain injury so this is concussions cbis and things like that so you can go and watch that whole episode and download that whole grade for all those details there but in that paper I remember we had a very short section regarding lactate yeah and what do we know about lactate for concussions and stuff like that and so before you answer that I want to set the stage just a tiny bit um you can feel free to maybe double tap on Crea a little bit here since we we brought it up but I think it&amp;#39;s really important you have I&amp;#39;ve seen you give the best explanation I&amp;#39;ve ever seen of what a concussion actually is and what it is not M and so maybe just quickly tell us uh your egg analogy and uh and then that&amp;#39;ll help explain a little bit of why maybe these things and do or don&amp;#39;t work for there so um how does a concussion actually work today&amp;#39;s episode is sponsored by momentus momentus makes the highest quality supplements on the market period many of you know me and you know that but I do not trust the vast majority of supplement companies and for good reason many Studies have shown that anywhere between 10 to up to 40% of supplements have accidental contaminants intentional alterations mislabeling or other serious issues but momentus is different I literally spent years vetting the company their products and leadership team before personally officially partnering with them in 2023 every single one of momentus this products is third-party tested to ensure quality and many are even NSF certified if for sport now while I love all of their products the ones I use the most both personally and with my clients are what I call the big three and these are the omega-3 fish oil creatine and newly improved whey protein formula these three supplements have fantastic data supporting their benefits and they have been shown to be very safe across basically all populations of people young old men women Etc now nobody has to use supplements and I hope you never feel pressured to do so but if you&amp;#39;re interested in supplements it&amp;#39;s important that you get them from the highest quality providers so that&amp;#39;s why I stick exclusively to momentus if you&amp;#39;d like to give momentus to try go to liv.com perform to get 20% off your order again that&amp;#39;s live mous.com perform to get 20% off to zoom out for a second I think one of the reasons why we have really failed to produce consistent therapies or repr uble therapies for concussions is because we don&amp;#39;t study them properly and we don&amp;#39;t study them properly because we don&amp;#39;t understand them properly hard to fix when you can&amp;#39;t Define exactly and so what is normally done or when people think about a concussion and if you read papers you&amp;#39;ll still see this um consistently experts in the field talking about it you you&amp;#39;ll hear something like the slos effect um or you know you imagine a head getting bashed and then like the brain banging around inside the skull like hitting one side of hitting one side of the skull then banging and hitting the other side that&amp;#39;s what they call a contra coup injury which is basically you see some injury on the opposite side from from where the impact occurred the brain is you know it&amp;#39;s mainly fat and water and it is then surrounded by fluid and it&amp;#39;s inside uh Solid box and that fluid is full of salt that fluid is full of salt if you take a solid box full of water even if it&amp;#39;s got something very fragile inside and you shake it really hard that fragile thing does not bang against the sides because the water is Right buffers it or the you know the CSF of the the fluid I saw you do this it was the one of the coolest things I&amp;#39;ve ever seen you took an egg and you put it in a jar with salt water I don&amp;#39;t remember the concentration you put it in oh it&amp;#39;s was just like normal normal sting yeah and you you know screwed the top of a ball jar or whatever it was and you shook the living crap out of the egg and the yolk didn&amp;#39;t break yeah at all no cuz it&amp;#39;s not hitting anything no it&amp;#39;s smashed it stays right in the it stays right in the middle I in that moment I went I what like everything because I had said that always I did not know that until you showed me that yeah not me but you&amp;#39;re were showing other people and I was like wow so if if you could while I&amp;#39;m shaking it image the jar what you would see is you would see distortions um along the surface of the egg yolk inside inside this jar so there are distortions so the egg instead of being a perfect circle turns into an oval it&amp;#39;s not smashing against the wall it&amp;#39;s just being just stored in and it&amp;#39;s being um accordioned exctly squished and and pulled back apart right so how we generally study concussions is the other version of of the egg experiment which I also showed which is that you have your your egg yolk in your solution and you leave a big chunk of air in the top of the jar you shake that immediately it turns into salad dressing right immediately you disperse that egg Yol throughout the liquid that&amp;#39;s how we normally study concussion but what happens um if you then look at where injury is in people who&amp;#39;ve had concussions so like you look at individuals who have uh CTE right they probably have some ongoing history of concussions it&amp;#39;s happened multiple times if you look at where the injury has accumulated it&amp;#39;s not at the surface of of the brain it&amp;#39;s not the brain bang against the skull What&amp;#39;s happen is that these distortions like waves of energy that are transferred through the brain is at the interfaces of different parts of the brain so particularly the interfaces between the gray matter on the outside and the white matter underneath it&amp;#39;s connective tissue yeah they&amp;#39;re tearing the connector yeah so right at the usually right at the base of the sulai so you think about the brain is really wrinkly right those are the gy the the sort of the diots in between those wrinkles the sulai at the base of those that&amp;#39;s where you tend to see uh injury and it&amp;#39;s because you have uh tissues of different densities where then the Distortion travels at different rates so then you create this shearing effect at those interfaces and then that&amp;#39;s right and if the shearing effect is very large you can rip axons you create direct direct axonal injury um if it&amp;#39;s a blast wave then obviously you&amp;#39;re not directly shearing anything but you still you still seem to injure those same areas because the energy wave is transferring through the brain at at different rates and so that&amp;#39;s where the injur accumulates out at those interfaces so then how do things like creatine and lactate help do they work at all and if so how I&amp;#39;ve been uh really excited about the potential for lactate in traumatic brain injury and and that uh excitement aligns very similar to with ketones um but people have been talking about them for a long time and I&amp;#39;m still waiting for some good some good human studies I&amp;#39;ve been probably talking about it for a decade online like in front of people on podcasts and things like that yeah so I I believe that they could be beneficial but we just haven&amp;#39;t seen really high quality evidence yet however now that&amp;#39;s clear you haven&amp;#39;t seen evidence that shows they don&amp;#39;t work either stud just aren&amp;#39;t being done no no and if if I were to get a significant concussion or TBI like I&amp;#39;m going straight to the keton Esters because I believe that there&amp;#39;s a high chance of benefit with low risk anybody who&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t have a randomized control trial to tell you that that&amp;#39;s the case but you know I think it could if it was my brain that&amp;#39;s what I would do as an mdphd in brain health this is what you would do infer that for what you will folks uh part of it is that it&amp;#39;s essentially providing some kind of metabolic substrate in an area of the brain where there is impaired metabolism so one of the consistent responses you see to an acute brain injury and again Strokes cardiac arrest traumatic brain injuries is what we call Energy failure so there&amp;#39;s this uh gap between energy requirements and energy Supply because you have dysfunctional mitochondria ketones and lactate can kind of bypass some of that and seem to be um less uh Le less energy energetically expensive or they&amp;#39;re more energetically efficient in terms of generating ATP like the effect is small but in that kind of setting a small effect um may you know may be enough to help to help minimize injury there&amp;#39;s also going to be some other signaling effects that that could that could be beneficial um like both lactate and ketones have a whole range of other um anti-inflammatory um neurotrophic kind of effect so so lactate seems to help and Ketone seem to help drive an increase in production in bdnf brain deriv neurotrophic factor which could help uh recovery so beyond their effect on um your metabolism they may have have these other Downstream uh effects as well but another reason why this is important is that in the acute uh injury setting the brain may become relatively uh insensitive to glucose or glucose uptake decreases so um but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the case because the the transporter is different and both ketones and lactate go in through the monoc carboxilate Transporters which aren&amp;#39;t necessarily affected in that state so some of it could be that particularly ketones might be more um uh metabolic efficient in terms of energy production but also they maybe more likely to get into the brain in the setting of of an acute injury to help support are they potentially less negatively influenced by inflammatory markers as well um yes potentially although I mean it kind of depends on what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on and how they&amp;#39;re getting in I don&amp;#39;t naturally associate physical structural damage with metabolic problems MH what&amp;#39;s the connection here why is it if I have a structural tear this is a case in muscle by the way yeah that my my brain is well then it&amp;#39;s inflammation it&amp;#39;s damage so you need to give me something that&amp;#39;s anti-inflammatory nids or some other drug that is going to reduce the inflammation or you need to give me something that&amp;#39;s going to repair the structure DHA fish oil like some structural thing yeah why are we seeing and having to deal with and why are metabolic issues so prevalent glucose disregulation things like that and then why is energetic the solution when we have a physical structural tear so one of the reasons why you have impaired glucose metabolism is because of the inflammatory response and a normal inflammatory response creates peripheral insulin resistance in order to divert glucose to the immune system in order to in order to respond so because it has to have energy the immune system has to get energy as well so that that that&amp;#39;s a good thing in order to to generate a normal immune response but can then cause issues in other tissues because they become insulin resistant driven by the inflammatory response the direct Metabolic Effect of injury is due to the changes that happen at the cell or in in the nerves in response to that injury so if it&amp;#39;s um say like a direct shearing effect or um you know even in concussions where you haven&amp;#39;t um fully sheared neurons you may have stretched them um and you may have vascular changes that impair the ability to deliver oxygen to those tissues and in all of those settings you can get essentially a hyper stimulation of those neurons so they start to fire a bunch when you get this hypers stimulation of of neurons um and you see you can see this with low oxygen States or with you know acute sort of stretching if you sort of acutely stretch the neurons they increase their firing rate that creates a large production of what we call excitatory um neurotransmitters things like glutamate which are the yeah the most common one but there there are there are others that then starts this sort of wave of increase in signaling you then essentially hyper stimulate the downstream neurons you get these big shifts uh in calcium um within the cell and then that calcium impairs mitochondrial function and at very high levels can actually uh stimulate um what we call the mitochondrial permeability transition which is essentially the mitochondria saying I can&amp;#39;t take anymore and then that&amp;#39;s that then triggers cell death so it&amp;#39;s essentially an over stimulation which can be driven either by low oxygen or stretching um which then sort of creates this Cascade that impairs mitochondrial function you mentioned calcium again that was also the third part of our uh criteria we talked about earlier right like that having that third issue so I want to ask more about that but let me see if I can summarize what you just said quick in the case of a brain injury you&amp;#39;re going to immediately have some sort of inflammatory response which is a great thing right the whole point of the inflammatory response is to let your immune system know we need to divert attention and start physically mechanically repairing collagen and whatever else is there right unfortunately those immune cells require energy and so you have to then divert glucose to them yeah and the best way to divert glucose to them is to block it from going other places yes right now in this shortterm thing we&amp;#39;ve basically given other areas diabetes yeah right like we made them insulin resist istant on purpose so that we can focus our glucose to the immune cells the immune FS cells then show up to the place of injury this is all a good thing but because of that we&amp;#39;re going to start running into in fact we could also be dealing with tears and damage to the actual the membrane of the cells right themselves could be physically torn which then is going to allow things coming in and out of the cell that we don&amp;#39;t want and we have like calcium yeah and having other problems with that that&amp;#39;s the normal process if we were to then go take copious amounts of say anti-inflammatories at that stage and this is probably one of the reasons why they don&amp;#39;t do this m right um we are probably going to run into issues because we&amp;#39;re blocking that natural process right so we want some sort of I&amp;#39;m presuming inflammation uh immediately but probably not super excessive yes but not small yeah either right by the way I&amp;#39;m guessing all this because this is exactly how it works in bone and muscle yeah so tell me when I start to deviate here right I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m literally guessing so I I&amp;#39;ll jump in just quickly to say that um in general in in brain injury everybody&amp;#39;s thought that these inflammatory responses to injury are a bad thing and we should try and um try and prevent them and so far that that has generally failed and actually there are some therapies you know nothing that&amp;#39;s you know available right now but there are some therapies that seem to augment some of the initial responses to injury inflammatory response to injury so like in a minute it looks worse but actually that then ends up resulting in Improvement longer term there are Cascades of drugs that pre-dose Pro pro-inflammatory cyto kindes and whole Co and then give them to you like give an exaggerated yeah inflammatory response in in again another tissue I&amp;#39;m not surprised it&amp;#39;s in sameon bone or in the brain so once we get past that the issue then becomes if that stays around too long and now we&amp;#39;re starting to damage my Andria and now we&amp;#39;re having an issue with regulating energy and that&amp;#39;s why then providing energetic support so that the cell can stay alive right if that cell now in the case of the cell we&amp;#39;re talking about the brain cell runs out of energy then we&amp;#39;re going to die right and so it&amp;#39;s a hard time managing energy and this is why probably initially in the case of an acute injury we want to maintain temperature yes right that&amp;#39;s I know that&amp;#39;s one thing we covered uh a little bit in the paper but I know you spend a lot of time on because of this process right when things get really really hot metabolism has a hard time hanging on right so things get overheated managing blood glucose in general so that this curve is normal and then at that point providing energenic support yeah so those were kind of the three big areas for in the acute setting um where if you were to actually have a real injury and you were to get treatment in hospital like that&amp;#39;s particularly temperature and glucose are probably the two things are going to pay attention to most right yeah if were in an IC like a neuro IU because you had you had a significant uh traumatic brain injury then glucose regulation and therm regulation are known to be critically important I think in the we kind of hypothesize that in much less severe injuries these things are still relevant so we should think about them there haven&amp;#39;t been a ton of trials in that area because they&amp;#39;re hard to do but it kind of makes sense that you know just because you don&amp;#39;t have a massive injury doesn&amp;#39;t mean that those things aren&amp;#39;t important for you know quote unquote just a concussion compared to you know a major brain trauma what about things like at home brain tests so there whether these are uh Technologies where you can test cognitive function maybe not I doubt there&amp;#39;s any at home concussion tests that you can do um no so most most concussion tests they&amp;#39;re yeah generally require either um some kind of Baseline cognitive function test so there&amp;#39;s things like the um the impact test uh the the military have have their own version of this um there&amp;#39;s other tests that are probably more sensitive to concussions called the like the king devic uh test which is basically you have to read off uh a complex grid of numbers and letters that kind of like overlap if you can&amp;#39;t read them properly but you need like you need a baseline score and you need the same person to kind of administer it um you also see uh there are some some uh available devices where you can measure changes in event related potentials so uh the electrical signal that you get if you you know show somebody an auditory or visual stimulus um that seem to be pretty good predictors of like there&amp;#39;s actually been an effect of a concussion and then recovery but all of this kind of requires some kind of specialist to be involved usually um uh more broadly in terms of in terms of uh cognitive function what&amp;#39;s interesting is that there aren&amp;#39;t a ton of easily available cognitive function test that you can like just do at home and do repeatedly there are some apps and things that kind of have some of this stuff built in but it&amp;#39;s difficult to St difficult to standardize um one uh depending on if you have if you have say access to some kind of healthc care provider there are um nice companies like kayos which give a bunch of standardized cognitive function tests you can do at home on a desktop a lot of um neurologists and neuroscientist use something like that um I think um the main cognitive function test that I know of that anybody can do at home for free um and is validated is actually U it&amp;#39;s been put online by a charity that I work with uh in the UK called food for the brain and they have a a validated online cognitive function test that includes measures of um executive function working memory and processing speed and you can just like go on their website and you can just do it and you can track it over time the and we&amp;#39;re we we currently have a database of more than half a million people who&amp;#39;ve taken it and dozens of thousands of them also have done lifestyle questionnaires about sleep and all those kind of things we talked about so we&amp;#39;re in the process of doing a lot of research from that database like right at the beginning we&amp;#39;ve just sort of be be given access to be able to do some of that but people can do that test uh I will say that in terms of function test it&amp;#39;s one of the ones that has the biggest learning effect on the second attempt just because of the way this test is structured um so if you&amp;#39;re going to do it and you want to like track things over time I would do it a couple of times in succession so like you know it and then use the second or third time as your Baseline and then track and then track it over time um but there are there are a number of people now in this space because right I can now go to Quest or lab corop and I can get whatever blood test I want but I can&amp;#39;t get a really good well validated um multi-dimensional cognitive function test that something that you know we and other people are working on any other Technologies uh consumer based EG things that um you you can or cannot mention the exact products if you&amp;#39;d like but just where does that field stand I know that there&amp;#39;s probably half a dozen or more that immediately come to mind um some of them s in the front of my head some in my ears some back place like walk me through again you can SP specifics if you want or not but the general lay land of at home home based EEG technology I think it&amp;#39;s an area where there&amp;#39;s a ton of Promise um it&amp;#39;s just figuring out that&amp;#39;s never a good start no but in a I think in a in a good so I guess the short answer is is there anything that gives you everything you would want right now probably not um however with very simple EEG devices um and there are some that are set up in earphones so I think the one that&amp;#39;s um that I I know is most widely available or at least will be soon is is is this company called neurable um the one the frontal EEG like Muse is something that people were going to be familiar with and actually there were versions of the Muse that have the sensors around the ear as well some of the why does it matter if it&amp;#39;s in the front of the forehead versus the ear it depends and it depends on what you&amp;#39;re on what you&amp;#39;re looking at with some of my collaborators we&amp;#39;re looking at different um EG frequencies and people have heard of like alpha beta theta Delta and the different uh like the relative uh frequencies and power of these different um fre so like even within a frequency band uh people will have different average frequencies and then uh the the sort of the total amplitude of the wave is is the power and the the your mean frequency and Power in those different frequency bands relates to different aspects of cognitive function so uh certain aspects of alpha seem to predict um say learning speed for Lear learning a second language and some other aspects of cognitive function um some companies have created like Focus metrics so like you can tell when your brain is focused that&amp;#39;s either based on um uh certain measures of alpha or sometimes they have like a alpha plus beta divided by Delta plus Theta or some kind of ratio of the different frequencies and that stuff is is pretty good the problem is that each individual company kind of focuses on one thing right so you&amp;#39;re using it for neuro neuro feedback in kind of like a meditation type um uh setting yeah or you&amp;#39;re using it to kind of tell when you&amp;#39;re focusing well and then your focus is starting to drop off and maybe it&amp;#39;s time to to take a break I think that you could get a lot more uh and and broader information about somebody&amp;#39;s cognitive function over time with some of these Technologies even even simple setups but just nobody&amp;#39;s really done that yet so kind of selling Focus or selling meditation that stuff&amp;#39;s great like don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I think it&amp;#39;s an important start but I think there&amp;#39;s a lot more that could be done if we had the right information and we sort of track in people over time yeah so the only well perhaps not maybe the only but the largest consideration there for the consumer is just that last Point yeah so it&amp;#39;s going to be at least that I&amp;#39;m aware of that you&amp;#39;re aware of any consumer faced product there is going to have one particular aspect of cognitive function but it will almost certainly not test nor train and help you evaluate other aspects of cognitive function function which is not their fault this is a more than small technological yeah really yeah challenging the calcium question yes right so what does calcium have to do with this entire project why does it matter if calcium influx is happening or this um ayot toxicity with glutamate what&amp;#39;s that got to do with it and then does calcium work then as a supplement I can take to enhance cognitive function to deal with brain andry walk us through the story with calcium so I I think this is another area where um the brain and muscle kind of tell a similar story right we know that muscular and the Heart Right the muscular contraction is driven by cycling of um calcium right and a lot of signaling processes including mitochondrial function and then the transfer of um information um across cells in the brain is driven by waves of calcium and so that then you know opens and closes um different channels it you know activates or deactivates different entic processes it regulates bondal function just like it does um in in the muscles so when you have large you know excessive or unregulated um influx of calcium into a cell you know one of the prototypical downstream effects is mitochondrial dysfunction and eventually lighten mitochondrial death and you mitochondrial death you essentially have cell totally totally that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to see is sell um so when you then think about like calcium as a supplement obviously th those those two things don&amp;#39;t go directly together uh you can&amp;#39;t take more calcium and then have better regulation of um energetics in the brain unfortunately because it&amp;#39;s just a lot more complicated than that but I think this is where some other things come into play like we know that like so vitamin D is really is really important for cognitive function one of its Ro I mean it&amp;#39;s essentially a steroid hormone but one of its roles is in the regulation of calcium so that you know that it could be playing a role there we know like magnesium and calcium play together and often sort of like playing off one another we know that magnesium is really critical there so some of these other factors that we know are important for cognitive function may be playing a role through regulation of calcium but if you was going to take more calcium um it&amp;#39;s unfortunately it&amp;#39;s not going to just end up in your brain and improve cognitive function unless you know for whatever reason you were calcium deficient which is relatively rare usually it&amp;#39;s other factors um vitamin K status you know other things that that that are playing a big role there yeah I mean uh what&amp;#39;s the RDA for calcium thousand milligrams a day like something like that right you don&amp;#39;t rarely see people or you don&amp;#39;t often see people it might be like 7 or 800 milligrams it&amp;#39;s not that much okay maybe see lesson yeah pretty I mean a smidgens of broccoli and it&amp;#39;s like some Dairy like you&amp;#39;re probably there Prett you eat any dairy you&amp;#39;ll hit your idea of calcium yeah you&amp;#39;re not going to smash that up there and also seems to be one of the the minerals particularly that doesn&amp;#39;t like to be outside of its window yeah in the sense that if you get a little bit high in magnesium particularly if you really physically active that&amp;#39;s probably okay yeah in fact like often times that&amp;#39;s good yeah uh you don&amp;#39;t want to do that with calcium no and it&amp;#39;s even more tightly it&amp;#39;s even more tightly regulated because it&amp;#39;s essentially a trigger for so many and like it&amp;#39;s how so many biological processes are regulated your heart will stop yeah so you needed to be your brain will stop like it&amp;#39;s not a good thing yeah way low way high so it&amp;#39;s not one and for those cases I mean thinking back over your career how many times you think you&amp;#39;ve recommended calcium supplementation based on blood work or things like that I think the only time you routinely recommended it was in like osteoporotic older individuals but you were taking it with vitamin D and we were trying to You Know cover some other bases as well so like just giving like Calum on its own I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever recommended yeah so not in your performance enhancement with your athletes not in your practice as a medical doctor none of those things right I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever given it though so magnesium like ubiquitously yeah like everybody people down with it totally and but calcium is probably not one of the ones so probably not one of the markers we&amp;#39;re going to go after for either cognitive enhancement or the brain injury things like that okay you have said three things thus far in our conversation that have irritated probably many people are you remind them what they are I am and then I want to see if we can go for a fourth okay one thing you said was that things like micro doing psychedelics and marijuana probably don&amp;#39;t potentially don&amp;#39;t necessarily enhance creativity yeah they certainly enhance your perception of it but maybe actually you&amp;#39;re not doing better work you&amp;#39;re just high and thinks your stuff is great when it sucks okay that was number one whole internet will hate me for that too the second thing you said was actually that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re fairly convinced at this point that we can actually enhance cognitive function which doesn&amp;#39;t sound controversial to some but for others are going to be really upset about that and what you mean by that is General so that is transferable to other modes of cognitive function as we just talked about focus is not the same as executive function that&amp;#39;s not the same as word recall Etc and that that can be improved and we laid out various cases for that third one you said was that in fact concussions and brain injuries are not your brain slamming against your skull um that probably could happen it&amp;#39;s plausible but most likely you have either temperature or Distortion or metabolic issue or combinations of us there fourth one and I&amp;#39;ve heard you on records so true or false here you are of the opinion that dementia and late onset Alzheimer&amp;#39;s not early onset to be clear are 100% preventable I&amp;#39;ve never said 100% okay all right okay I would say so um and this really at this point shouldn&amp;#39;t be controversial because again Dusty neurological institutions led by establishment individuals would say the same thing um that I would say that so the the party line is that 45% of dementia is probably de uh preventable that&amp;#39;s from the lanet commission run by Gil Livingston and a bunch of experts across across the world it was just updated it used to be 40% now it&amp;#39;s 45% they increased the number of risk factors that they included I would say it&amp;#39;s easily the majority because there were some things that they didn&amp;#39;t include 60 plus per 70 plus% so other estimates um so say uh yinu who&amp;#39;s at Fudan University and his group have done a ton of uh modeling and prediction from large population data sets they think that somewhere between you know up to 70 something per of dementia is preventable if we were able to address all the different risk factors that contribute to it okay so this is an enormous departure yeah from what the Lexicon right so not only potentially is it a departure from the scientific Community but if you were to walk down the street and just ask people about first of all they&amp;#39;ll call it Alzheimer&amp;#39;s probably right yeah um but dementia I don&amp;#39;t know anyone who thinks that this is anything besides this just happens with age or it&amp;#39;s like cancer where it&amp;#39;s just a bad luck of the draw potentially some people might think oh it&amp;#39;s you know if I drink a lot of alcohol but I don&amp;#39;t think many people think it&amp;#39;s anything besides those ones so not only are you saying that that is not the case yeah but it is in large part call it even 40% is impressive but probably more realistically 70 plus perc of dementia is extinguishable so two-part question is this a prevention issue or is this a reversal there are certainly some people out there who who working with individual clinical cases have said they have seen what they feel is reversal of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease that I&amp;#39;m still not hard like because once you&amp;#39;ve reached that point of significant atch Fe and significant pathology it&amp;#39;s very difficult to um restore function and or you know reverse or structur structurally but then also to respond to some of the things that we know uh improve cognitive function so this is all this is all vention case studies maybe things like that that like in terms of reversal demena is the same case or just Alzheimer&amp;#39;s most of this is focused on Alzheimer&amp;#39;s but some people will say you know in in certain cases of front temporal Dementia or Louis body dementia they&amp;#39;ve seen significant improvements in cognitive function and it&amp;#39;s by generally addressing the same things but I I wouldn&amp;#39;t come here and promise reversal but I do think prevention um there&amp;#39;s you know massive potential slowing down onset slowing down progression is certainly thing yeah we we&amp;#39;ll talk about that separate I&amp;#39;ll keep it going I&amp;#39;ll bring you back to that so there&amp;#39;s reversing they&amp;#39;re stopping the progression and they&amp;#39;re stopping it from happening yes so okay continue on with the prevention piece so um and I think all of all of this is essentially um all of this is connected and and the same risk factors apply essentially across the board uh regardless of where you&amp;#39;re trying to intervene it probably just gets harder the further you go along so when uh they classify them in the lanet commission report they sort of classify them by stages of life so early life the most significant uh modifiable risk factor is is education so the more years of education you have the lower your risk of later dementia and uh then late life cognitive stimulus also becomes important and uh that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s been shown again in meta analyses by Professor y use group and is Incorporated in into this lantic commission report so I think that&amp;#39;s a good place to start because it fits with my worldview that stimulus is really important that&amp;#39;s always good and so um and you have by the way you and Josh have a paper Open Access paper we&amp;#39;ll fully link to that in the show notes so you guys can go fully read that but yeah continue on if you want to read this whole breakdown that paper will be up yeah so you can kind of hear think about this idea and again it&amp;#39;s sort of driven by that same idea that stimulating to like the function of a tissue is directly proportional to the stimulus applied to it the liver is the same the immune system is the same muscles the same and so when you look at trajectories of cognitive function across the lifespan um and there were you know multiple M analyses and a lot of this has to be observational but what you see is that um those who have more years of education they have a higher peak of cognitive function and that&amp;#39;s you you spend more time you know devoting more resources to enhancing cognitive function I got I&amp;#39;m sorry to cut you off for like the fourth time but I have to linger on that point it makes intuitive sense that the more time modern education than hands cognitive function I have right but that&amp;#39;s not what you just said what you just said was you reach a higher Peak yeah I I hope people are sinking in on what the heck that that means right we all can progress we can improve but getting to a higher total maximum Peak is really it&amp;#39;s not the same as just increasing in speed and it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s stunning me about this and I&amp;#39;ll keep going back to it you will see the same thing with bone mhm right the maximum bone density you get is going to be predicted by what you did between ages 10 to 14 yeah now the rate of increasing is like pretty much ubiquitous like up and down is the same but determining how high that Peak is is all about what you do in that window so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m just like so stunned right now that uh I knew the increase right I could certainly would have said hey would you improve cognitive function like yes if you train but I I would was not anticipating you would say that that the height of that Peak is going to be determined by that as well yeah cuz you&amp;#39;re going to deal with that the downside the rest of your life exactly yeah and so you know a lot of other things go into that but you generally see that people that the higher your uh so if you think about Peak cognitive function which depending on what it what cognitive function you&amp;#39;re looking at and how you measure it the peak is going to be somewhere between 20 and 30 years old and it generally an individual Peaks sometimes sometime around the time they finish formal education right so all that kind of lines up to say that the more time you spend on that the higher the peak and at that Peak the peak is higher in those who on average who have longer education across multiple methods of testing cognition cogni function yeah and right you have to talk about the fact that you know different people get access to longer periods and like so all of that plays right social economic status plays a big role and access plays a big role here right but I think in the last commission report they said that 5% of dementia was preventable if just like everybody got adequate yeah got adequate education and the reason for that is so if we then imagine some trajectory of congressed decline um that occurs in everybody on and like the rate is is different and we can we can change the rate of decline but if all you did was educate people more early in life they would have a higher Peak the rate of decline would be the same but they&amp;#39;d reach the point of dementia later right because they&amp;#39;ve started from a higher Peak the same rate of decline means they reach dementia later and you know maybe they die of something else first and they never get dementia so like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how that then happens we also quickly Define age there early and age is that like adolesence is that high school is that all of it just kind of ly in terms of what uh you just said that that the higher more education we give them early in life oh yeah so this is just like the traditional education years right so like you go up not a specific hey between age five and eight is the most no so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just total years of education so did you do complete High School like bachelor&amp;#39;s degree graduate school like is sort of a roughly linear relationship okay and then um there are several studies that show that late life ative um engagement or stimulus and they&amp;#39;ve measured it with like how often you go like you read books and go to museums and all these kinds of things or they&amp;#39;ve done it through like how cognitively stimulating is your work that then also slows or is associated with a slower rate of Decline and also a slower uh uh or a lower risk of dementia so there was one study they actually included and sort of stole the forest plot from it and they included it in the Lan commission report they had early life education and then they had how cognitively stimulating your job was and what they saw was that people who had more early life education um and but not a stimulating job and cognitiv stimulating job and people who had less early life education but a cognitively stimulating job later in life they had about the same risk of dementia so you can offset um a lower education early in life with more cognitive stimulation later in life the lowest risk was obviously those who had both but um it&amp;#39;s yes there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of benefit you get from that early stimulation through education but it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re you now written in stone like this is your destiny I have a higher risk of dementia if you didn&amp;#39;t get that because there&amp;#39;s lots of evidence that suggest that stimulation either through your job or other things will then slow that decline later in life so so you can still do something about it later it&amp;#39;s so interesting because you&amp;#39;re like halfway between muscle and bone now yeah such that the muscle you develop as a child has almost no bearing m on how much muscle you can develop if you start lifting weights for the first time at 50 your rate of increase in muscle growth will be the same yeah as if you lifted weights when you were 10 or not or basically like that so in there that case like earlier development has very little bearing on progression like so how the rate of increase that said bone is the opposite like whatever you get basically as a kid in large part is is going to determine where you&amp;#39;re at there so you have this Halfway House of where muscle is not relying upon you know when you&amp;#39;re a kid bone almost entirely and now what you&amp;#39;re saying is like brain is a little bit of both you got either one right you can do it early in life you can do it late in life obviously both is great or worst case here and and I would have to imagine I don&amp;#39;t know if you actually know the numbers here but the folks that were the double dipping on the bad side MH so no education and low cognitive demanding job I have to imagine their rates of Alzheimer and uh dementia as well as progression is probably the most aggressive there by by an order not maybe maybe not a magnitude but some fold yeah so in in this um uh in this paper was published in the in the bmj a few years ago they like that was your reference group and then everybody else just did just did better right just 2.0&amp;#39;s 2.7 yeah just doubling over there okay so I guess if you had a great childhood education tremendous don&amp;#39;t rest on your laurels continue to challenge cognitive demanding whatever that may be if you didn&amp;#39;t though you still can regain much of that by doing something just don&amp;#39;t use that to have your mind numbing job um as where there so it is in either case largely preventable the I think the the departure here is um early onset Alzheimer&amp;#39;s yeah is is a different ball game entirely here right we I don&amp;#39;t want to spend too much time here but now you&amp;#39;re probably looking at probably opposite like 70 plus percent is maybe even higher is genetic and bad draw here so so I think just just to finish the the the first piece like we think about life stages and think about the life stages of risk factors then um in the middle of Life a lot of what they&amp;#39;re talking talking about is body composition physical activity um smoking alcohol you know all the stuff that we&amp;#39;ve talked about already in terms of if we eliminated those we could eliminate yeah you know the related dementia and then one thing that we haven&amp;#39;t talked about before or at least not related to this is sensory inputs so that&amp;#39;s some of the late life risk factors they talk about obviously brain trauma is another one in midlife yeah but no sensory to like vision and hearing yeah so there&amp;#39;s now a pretty good body of evidence suggests that if you have cataracts you have a higher risk of dementia that Dem that risk is reversed if you have cataract surgery if you have hearing loss like presbycusis as you get older you have a higher risk of um dementia that is reversed particularly in high-risk people uh if you get hearing aids so if you start to lose a sense right and a lot of people just like I&amp;#39;m going to battle through because you know I don&amp;#39;t want to have a hearing aid or whatever oh do don&amp;#39;t do that you know if you start to have hearing loss get a hearing aid because that&amp;#39;s going to be associated with a lower risk of dementia so making sure you&amp;#39;re still getting those sensory inputs into the brain uh remains really critical so don&amp;#39;t lose your sense of smell don&amp;#39;t lose your vision don&amp;#39;t lose your hearing probably in the I&amp;#39;m going to guess 50 to 60 year range like if you start getting in that age window and you start seeing precipitate declines in any of those functions and you want to reverse that as quickly as you possibly can um because of what you&amp;#39;ve been saying all day yeah if you can&amp;#39;t hear stimuli doesn&amp;#39;t go in there then that part of your brain presumably dies it makes perfect sense right you&amp;#39;re not using those networks anymore so they&amp;#39;re going to decline but then all you know everything else they&amp;#39;re connected to is going to be affected as I assume the same thing is true with Pro perception in terms of balance things like that right so make sure that you continue to train balance work on balance I think this is a pretty easy story to tell for exercise in nature yeah right exercising in the outdoor like exercising inside in the gym is great but now you&amp;#39;re outside you&amp;#39;re going up and down you&amp;#39;re seeing different things hearing smelling like so on and so forth differing light exposures like the effect of say seeing green spaces on you autonomic nervous system regulation or there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a t yeah there&amp;#39;s a ton of different ways that that that could okay so I&amp;#39;m on board there um it&amp;#39;s highly preventable you said this earlier as well you talked about exercise a bunch MH um this was one of the more stunning Parts about our earlier conversation when you said and I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m stupified that I never made this connection I&amp;#39;ve said this a thousand times a thousand plus thousands of times and like I never really grasp the fact that when you exercise you&amp;#39;re going to have neurological neuroplasticity nerve nerve nerve but then the actual structure of the brain and I promise we would I wanted to come back there so here we are coming back to it it&amp;#39;s like the second time I&amp;#39;ve actually come back to a topic I said I wanted to come back to but I want you to explain this to me about how it&amp;#39;s actually what what aspects of the what areas of the brain physically are improved by exercise does itpe determine or does it depend on the type of exercise is strength training different um do we know any details about the exercise is it a certain amount of sets or reps or Styles like what do we know um so what do I do and how does it actually help and then the last part about that is is there a a law of hey I didn&amp;#39;t start soon enough yeah so now it&amp;#39;s too late all right so give me the jazz on how lifting weights makes my brain what do you call it like bigger bigger muscles bigger brains more bigger more brainia more bigger more brainia there you go I&amp;#39;ve heard you say that before um so a good place to start is the the first ever study I think that was done that showed that you could increase the size of a certain part of of the brain in humans was with an exercise intervention was published in 2011 exercise for the win I&amp;#39;m telling you folks exercise scientists run science you just don&amp;#39;t like to admit it um so this published in PN in 2011 and what they did is oh that recent yeah oh wow yeah so there was the so like before then we knew that so if you just looked at brains of people who&amp;#39;d recently died you could see that there were certain areas of the brain that were there was some neurogenesis particularly the dentate gyus at hippocampus but to actually physically see an increase in size of a part of the brain this is the hippocampus which is generally just thought to get smaller and smaller over time that hadn&amp;#39;t that hadn&amp;#39;t been seen before yeah hard hard to do in humans yeah and so the other side of that is that we don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s more neurons being generated we know it&amp;#39;s bigger right so this is like it could be clear it could be exra Matrix there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of things that go into that but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily matter we can we see improvements in in uh brain uh structure and volume with an exercise intervention so what they did in this study individuals in their 60s and 70s they had them do a walking program 40 minutes three times a week for a year that&amp;#39;s it brisk walking and that was enough to significantly improve or increase the size of the hippocampus these are non- exercisers these are non- exercises yeah and they sort of like worked their way up to a certain intensity and they did it for 40 minutes three times a week for a year the increases in size of the hippocampus correlated with improvements in V2 Max which also correlat with improvements in or increases in production of bdnf brain derived neurotrophic Factor so in a s sedentary population right we know we can see improvements in in uh the structure of the brain with with exercise with aerobic exercise what was interesting is that in this study they didn&amp;#39;t necessarily see significant improvements in cognitive function they saw improvements in structure but function didn&amp;#39;t necessarily truck with it part of this is probably an intensity piece so there was a very recent study that looked at um different levels of intensity of exercise aerobic exercise again and structure and function of of hippocam of the hippocampus so again so now we&amp;#39;re thinking about memory related uh tests and they found the greatest benefit in individuals doing high intensity exercise training it was essentially the Norwegian 4x4 Pro like 4 minutes it&amp;#39;s at you know uh 75 to 80% Max V like V2 Max um uh heart rate sorry and they saw maintenance of structure of volume of the hippocampus compared to control groups where it kind of where those decreased and M and improvements in in cognitive function they think related to the area of the brain so some um aerobic activity of any kind in people who are sedentary if it improves their cardiovascular fitness then you&amp;#39;re going to see improvements in brain structure to see correlated improvements in brain function intensity is probably going to be important they in that study they&amp;#39;re generating a ton of lactate right whereas they weren&amp;#39;t in that original Walking study right so that that could be that could be one one way wi again so um in general what you see across multiple studies is that the gray matter of the brain so now we&amp;#39;re talking the the outer cortex and hippocampus primarily seems to be benefited by aerobic exercise and in general arobic exercise seems to be associated with improvements in memory right again the hippocampus is is is really important there you if we&amp;#39;re thinking about the amount that you have you have to do it&amp;#39;s essentially going to be you know two or three times a week some kind of activity that is improving your cardiovascular fitness wherever you&amp;#39;ve started from right but probably at least once a week doing something that&amp;#39;s very intense right some kind of some kind of Sprint type or high high intensity interval training at least that&amp;#39;s what sort of aligns with the literature in terms of resistance exercise you see benefits in different areas of the brain so resistance exercise seems to primarily benefit the white matter which kind of sits between the cortex and the deep brain and right that&amp;#39;s where you have your mated axons the fast connections um like that&amp;#39;s the hypers speed zone the hypers speed zone is the transfer of information from the brain to the body and throughout the brain and uh so we actually just published a review paper talking about the studies where they&amp;#39;ve done a resistance training intervention compared to a control group and then looked at brain structure over time and this is what you see is Improvement either improvements in the wipe in the white matter or prevention of decline of the structure of of the white matter um and then that&amp;#39;s also associated with um improvements in cognitive function particularly with resistance training executive function so like prefrontal cortex function so different areas of the brain affected by different types of exercise which then associated with different improvements in cognitive function the uh minimum effective dose um seat for like sustained Improvement seems to be two sessions a week um like super standard six to eight exercises covering the whole body for three sets of 8 to 12 reps just like the most basic resistance training program twice a week for at least six months and you see significant improvements in brain structure and Associated cognitive function so those are kind of the different ways that those different exercises kind of come together then then you get more of like a Glo if you do both hopefully some kind of global Improvement ctive function so it is never been shown I know this but it would based on all that be reasonable to presume if I wanted to develop an exercise program that was specifically targeted with the primary objective of keeping my brain as healthy as long as possible not necessarily my body composition or muscle or strength or anything like that um I wanted to do an exercise program for that one could theoretically say Okay lift weights a couple of days a week in exactly what you mentioned you know five to eight exercises whole body Yeah couple sets each yeah that&amp;#39;d be two days a week one day a week do something that is closer let&amp;#39;s just even say the Norwegian 4x4 that&amp;#39;s a great option yeah four minutes of the highest amount of work people get mad when you describe this as four minutes of Max effort are all out you can&amp;#39;t go all out for four minutes but the the highest amount of work you can do for four minutes rest for four minutes and do it again I don&amp;#39;t really think friends like I cannot imagine a world in which that specificity matter yeah you don&amp;#39;t have to do the for you could probably do just about any type of high-intensity endurance conditioning work and it would probably be the same but let&amp;#39;s just say for Simplicity you did 4x4 once or twice a week was that those interventions I think they were doing it three times a week okay but if you&amp;#39;re doing other aerobic exercise and and resistance training I think you&amp;#39;re gonna yeah you&amp;#39;re probably not going to need to do like 4x4 three times a week that Su that&amp;#39;s pretty damn hard especially for six months of time yeah yeah I&amp;#39;m going to say realistically as an exercise scientist I&amp;#39;ll give you permission to cut that to two yeah per week yeah and then maybe one to two or three sessions a week of the more lower intensity standard endurance exercise cardio whether this is even physical activity walking yeah uh or would they actually need to do more like 50 60% heart rate for that kind of cardiovascular adaptation so you know this is that this is the the age-old question is like it like what&amp;#39;s the exact intensity required to see a specific adaptation I think that and it&amp;#39;s the same we did a we did a podcast talking about the 4x4 your podcast on on my podcast and um then somebody was like well what if I can&amp;#39;t maintain my heart rate in that zone for that long like just do yeah right do whatever you can for four minutes and you right you&amp;#39;ll get better over time and so I think it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s the same thing yeah like if it&amp;#39;s a if it&amp;#39;s a casual stroll you&amp;#39;re probably not getting um an adaptation but you know equally if if a brisk walk is hard work for you right then that&amp;#39;s going to be that that that&amp;#39;s going to be a good good place to be yeah this one roused me up so much because I I get it people want like specific numbers but I&amp;#39;m so resistant to do that because it doesn&amp;#39;t actually matter usually yeah it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a rough concepts of where you&amp;#39;re at so if those numbers help you great but something like that um here&amp;#39;s the reality don&amp;#39;t think that your brain all of a sudden won&amp;#39;t adapt yeah if you do half that yeah yeah if you did one day of lifting one day of intervals and a couple of days of walking it&amp;#39;s better than the zero oh yeah it&amp;#39;s a lot better yeah right so you don&amp;#39;t have to hit that minimum number to get any effect whatsoever right probably getting closer to that Final Destination but if that takes you six months or six years to get to where you can handle that that being that little three you know protocol we talked about it&amp;#39;s fine yeah like get there eventually and and you&amp;#39;ll probably get um much of the benefit which which is great this actually answers a big question that I have dealt with a lot you and I actually have a a paper together again that you led where we found physical strength predicted I think it was 5% yeah of cognitive function right and I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll say that again like physical strength predicted 5% of cognitive function I have talked about people have talked about at length how leg strength how grip strength grip strength fires people up right and the common claim here is like a grip strength is just a proxy for overall health yeah and certainly true MH um if you look at research on folks that have dementia you will see I think actually one paper found I can&amp;#39;t even think it was UK bank paper about a half a million people in it found that I think 30% of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s death was explained by low grip rate yeah right not a small number and there&amp;#39;s a recent study showing that Frailty preed like precedes like Alzheimer&amp;#39;s by by several years on average multiple years I imagine right and right if you&amp;#39;re frail you&amp;#39;re not doing all the things that we know continue to stimulate or support brain function right so what I want you to kill and perhaps this is the fifth thing that&amp;#39;ll irritate the internet that we&amp;#39;re going to call is the idea that this stuff the grip strength leg strength is exclusively an indirect or a correlation right of course there&amp;#39;s some yeah folks who are struggling with dementia are probably also then GNA struggle with movement and there&amp;#39;ll be a backwards direction right there&amp;#39;ll be a causation but it would kind of be backwards yeah causation right so and this horrible idea that strength is only a correlation to brain health and you just actually kind of answered the question before which is like how is it actually caal but then spell this out as directly as possible so I can cut this clip and send it to people every damn time I get told it&amp;#39;s just a correlation technically people are right a lot of this comes from epidemiological research correlation isn&amp;#39;t causation um however there were several studies we just talked about some where you randomize some to a resistance training intervention their strength improves brain function improves right brain structure improves and actually related to the point that you making in that in one of those studies yes you see sustained improvements in white matter structure with two sessions a week but you got improvements in cognitive function with just one session a week right so you don&amp;#39;t that these effects particularly if people aren&amp;#39;t doing much exercise are essentially linear and like so I I if you could ask for a more causal function and structure benefit and in a dose response yeah so what else do we that essentially says it&amp;#39;s causal right yeah and people are so depending on the type of research of course people are right you you can&amp;#39;t tell you can&amp;#39;t tell causation however what people also don&amp;#39;t necessarily understand is that in a perfect epidemiological study if you could account for every confounder and you know mediating and moderating relationships what you have left is causation that is like by Def that is a definition of causation so yes epidemiological studies technically don&amp;#39;t show causation but if you could it&amp;#39;s difficult because you don&amp;#39;t always get the variables you want right you can determine causation from an epidemiological study that is possible that&amp;#39;s allowed in you know a frequenc model of Statistics I&amp;#39;ll count that as like 4.5 thing that internet&amp;#39;s going to get mad at yeah you don&amp;#39;t think people understand basic statistics with that so um right people have worse physical health right we know so in the study that we did if you had higher uh blood blood sugar high hb1 C you had lower strength but I think that&amp;#39;s also bidirectional right you know more insulin resistance that&amp;#39;s going to worsen um muscular function but um if we think about the potential mechanisms by which this happens you have uh if you&amp;#39;re doing things that improve strength that&amp;#39;s Direct neuromuscular stimulus we&amp;#39;ve already talked about the importance of stimulus the next important thing is that your skeletal muscle is your biggest and most important glucose snc so if we&amp;#39;re thinking about the importance of energy regulation then your muscle like the more muscle you have and the more you move it the greater amount of glucose you can move through that system and there I mean this has been done for decades and decades and decades so your your skeletal muscle and your physical activity are two of the best ways to improve glucose handling and energetic handling more broadly and then the final piece is that when you contract your muscles you release a whole bunch of stuff right your muscles are organs so lactate bdnf m c irin uh Lac Fe like pick your metabolite cinin like whatever like whatever it is like pick your favorite metabolite dour right um we&amp;#39;re still discovering like torine we&amp;#39;re still discovering on a like on a we basis the things that are released during exercise that have broad broad benefits so like all of that comes together to suggest that um yes it&amp;#39;s a bidirectional relationship but by improving muscular size and strength and function and those usually go together but not always depending on you know who you are um that&amp;#39;s there was four or five if not more different mechanisms that would directly Rel relate to improvements in cognitive function and brain health I I hope that ends the conversation I&amp;#39;m going to move on although we could probably have done a whole conversation just on that but one little piece here it makes sense to me energetically based on what you just describe it makes sense to me from a neuromuscular perspective that the strength training Works backwards right and so the same neurological system that makes you squeeze your hand together it starts in your brain keeps alive how does the white matter what&amp;#39;s the stimuli from exercising muscle cuz it makes sense when I think about muscle it doesn&amp;#39;t happen this way folks but as a teaching point if you think about I lifted some weights the muscles that I contracted they pulled they got stretched they contracted they got damaged again it doesn&amp;#39;t happen this way but I can I can paint that picture in my head I&amp;#39;m not stretching the tissue yeah in my brain when I&amp;#39;m lifting weights so how am I generating more or preserving my physical tissue outside of the metabolic and the um the asites and the nervous system side yes so I think all of those play play an important role um for instance we know that as as we age things like changes in in metabolic health and white matter structure in the brain probably better track with cognitive function than say something like amalo accumulation in your brain actually the the trajectory follows more closely and that&amp;#39;s going to be related to um so so the white Mass trajectory is going to be related to things like metabolic health for the for the reasons we talked about um but I think there&amp;#39;s a direct stimulating effect right as you are you know the both learning the new skill of of of like the muscular control required to uh move uh weight in that way I think you&amp;#39;re directly stimulating some of those Pathways so Pathways related to like motor pathways assoc like white matter Pathways associated with motor control I think you&amp;#39;ll directly stim ating those which and then we know as you stimulate those you offset all those things we talked about earlier in terms of adaptations that improve structure and function and then more broadly I think that&amp;#39;s where some of the um the signaling Pieces come into play what&amp;#39;s interesting is that there is an overlap in some of the things that are produced in aerobic exercise versus um uh resistance training but we do see region specific effects so it&amp;#39;s probably there&amp;#39;s like some some coupling of of what&amp;#39;s going of what&amp;#39;s going on like a specific stimulus plus um the sort of the hormonal M or the myokines and things that that are released um and I I think it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s some combination of that it&amp;#39;s really hard to test these mechanisms in humans and it&amp;#39;s actually also really hard to get rats to do bicep curls so um squats is easy but yeah yeah or um because they have like they do like they do um weighted weighted Wheels right so it&amp;#39;s kind of like a a weighted Jacobs Ladder kind of thing is what they do for resistance training in rats um but I think it&amp;#39;s some combination of those things if you look at this from the muscle skeletal muscle perspective I should probably be saying it that whole I always say muscle skeletal muscle all right a little bit different it doesn&amp;#39;t require damage yeah there&amp;#39;s another thing that people have this this false thought of you have to break a muscle down to grow back which is fundamentally not only not true but it actually doesn&amp;#39;t happen very often right it&amp;#39;s not generally what&amp;#39;s causing muscle damage it&amp;#39;s not causing soreness it&amp;#39;s not causing and it&amp;#39;s definitely not the stimuli to grow M you can simply change energetics MH and stimulate muscle growth skeletal muscle growth I can&amp;#39;t see why you couldn&amp;#39;t do that in the brain yeah it&amp;#39;s the same thing it doesn&amp;#39;t require a stretch and a damage yeah all of these adaptations are driven by an increase in energetic flux right that&amp;#39;s what it is at its most basic state and then that&amp;#39;s what that drives um neuroplasticity it drives autophagy it drives you know all these other regulatory processes that we know um are involved in aging and reversing those um and so anything you can do right locally in muscle improve increasing energetic flux through aerobic exercise you know and then the same any stimulus in the brain you&amp;#39;re increasing the amount of energy that&amp;#39;s moving through the system that acts as a stimulus that then the same same processes occur is that why you think those different modes of exercise produce different actual brain adaptations I think that&amp;#39;s parts of it yeah um sort of but all of those things seem to you know dissecting those exact Pathways hasn&amp;#39;t been done but it um if you think about well you get you get La you know you do a heavy set of leg press you release it lactate right um but and you release a lot of lactate when you do the 4x4 protocol but you get different you seem to get different responses in the brain so it&amp;#39;s the the the combination of of multiple things sort of coming together all right fascinating uh we&amp;#39;re going to press the button on more things you&amp;#39;re going to irritate the world about I don&amp;#39;t need the full dive here give me the the what we used to say in the &amp;#39;90s and 2000s the reader digest version I only now recently realize that kids have no idea what that means no that analogy now people like the what like all right tldr tldr well nobody reads anymore so right you mentioned TOA MH and amals yeah and for folks that don&amp;#39;t know this story these for many years have been surrogates or markers of of would you say brain aging brain damage or yeah sort of the brain pathology that&amp;#39;s then leads to Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disase right and then recently some information came out that um perhaps we&amp;#39;ll just leave the person nameless but one of the prominent scientists in this area had we&amp;#39;ll just say not necessarily fake data but there there was some controversy and so I&amp;#39;ve seen reactions that are on one side of the equation of like okay he he just used a couple of pictures in GRS scientists do this all the time he didn&amp;#39;t fake data he just kind of got lazy you submit grants and grants and grants and you&amp;#39;re using a representative image to show a concept like it&amp;#39;s not that big a deal all the way to ractions in the other side of equation which is okay 30 years of research in this area is all thrown out now yeah um if you feel like you can&amp;#39;t answer this quickly then that&amp;#39;s okay feel free to pass but uh where at do we know um should people still be worried about this Pro because you can test it people pay to get it tested how much should we worry about to in relation to brain health yes so this is a it&amp;#39;s a long question to answer because essentially it it starts with Alis Alzheimer and his mentor amo klin in Germany in the beginning of the 20th century um however um I think we can say that there has been this overriding or there&amp;#39;s still the overriding idea that um Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease is driven by something called the amid Cascade hypothesis um amalo precursor protein is produced in the brain normally it&amp;#39;s really important for neuroplasticity a whole bunch of things if you if you like got rid of outs of um AP and amid entirely basically the brain doesn&amp;#39;t function at all um and but there&amp;#39;s one so of this preor protein gets can get cut in different ways by these secretases one version of that um accumulates to create these sort of waxy amalo plaques when that happens that then stimulates the the production of towel so tow is normally part of the microtubular Cy skeleton of neurons like really important for like directing axons and where they go and how they connect and it sort of dissociates from that becomes phosphorated and accumulates and then that Dam build of tow is generally Associated as a bad thing yeah and then that sort of Damages neurons and that&amp;#39;s associated pick your poison here if you look at sleep yeah you will see basically an inverse relationship with sleep efficiency or Sleep Quality and Tow buildup like you you could pick this in any realm of there and and it&amp;#39;d be hard to ignore all yeah of those papers so um I I think this certainly plays a role I think the and there&amp;#39;s been an increasing number of voices that say that there are other things that have to be playing a significant role here as well so we&amp;#39;ve become really hyperfocused on this one pathway when this pathway like you said is triggered by a whole bunch of things that we know have effects Beyond how it affects that pathway right we know that sleep is important regardless of the fact that if you don&amp;#39;t sleep you accumulate a bit more amalo in the brain right so and we know that uh towel accumulates after head trauma but there are other effects that head trauma has Beyond its effect on towel so we&amp;#39;ve kind of really hyperfocused on this pathway but there&amp;#39;s a bunch of other stuff that&amp;#39;s happening at the same time and I think we could while we shouldn&amp;#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water because some of that is certainly playing a role I think we&amp;#39;ll miss um a huge amount of benefit from uh in people if if we don&amp;#39;t focus on the other things that are going on at the same time so I think there&amp;#39;s an even though and so there&amp;#39;s been some studies in with amalo where you know a similar problem you know some issues with the data maybe some of it was duplicated or fabricated I think there&amp;#39;s enough evidence to suggest this is playing a role I just think the role is probably smaller than we&amp;#39;ve kind of uh assumed it to have yeah I mean I&amp;#39;ll say that for you because I&amp;#39;m not in this field you may have to save face a little bit but I can only speak this from my area of Science and I&amp;#39;ve seen this game play out where um the funding sources the national funding sources just start onslot and probably for good reason initial papers come out it gets really exciting and they just put all the dollars yeah on one particular thing and this is by my read of the situation from the outside and this is basically what happened right and it becomes really hard with anybody else with an idea or an approach or a metric to get funding because they&amp;#39;re just throttling it all on one area and then when information like this comes out it becomes really disheartening and upsetting to folks who got their ideas shut down for yeah career MH and going we told you to stop focusing on that and and I think that&amp;#39;s somewhere in the neighborhood of a fair criticism if people are interested in this history they should read the book how not to study a disease by KL harup which kind of documents this exact process and that step that you were talking about this happened with the ni the National Institute of Aging they essentially said that um Alzheimer&amp;#39;s and amalo were synonymous uh through a few different position papers over time and so then it came to the point where if you want wanted to start study outside of disease you had had to study amalo that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that amalo doesn&amp;#39;t play a role it just means that they they kind of purposefully ignored um a lot of other research of of important things that that are taking part in the process man just beyond frustrating yeah just the whatever okay we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll save our piece on that uh I&amp;#39;ve got a handful of really quick questions just to finish us off here but before we do that a really fast recap you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve irritated the world on at least five points uh and gave us a lot a lot of light on if you want to enhance cognitive function you&amp;#39;re good but you&amp;#39;re trying to go to Great you talked about a lot of different ways to do that search for novelty in probably vision and hearing and brain training and and different things like that and an important note there is just because that actual cognitive task is impressive or complicated doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it&amp;#39;s cognitively demanding especially if you&amp;#39;ve been doing it a long time right if whatever that task may be uh if you are having some sort of deficit brain fog we&amp;#39;ll call it and you called it some other technical or I&amp;#39;m going to call it keep call it brain fog right make sure that you don&amp;#39;t have some sort of holistic Hole uh that is burning literally burning extra cognitive energy and so it&amp;#39;s not that you have brain fog per se it&amp;#39;s just that you are actually low on cognitive fuel physically because of external stressor or sleep or alcohol like some other micronutrient deficiency is is most likely uh at play there right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the most likely explanation or inflammatory from long covid like some of process like that um percussions are not your brain slamming against your skull wall and then a lot of strategies stimate what they actually are and that explained why those strategies work um and then that things that like marijuana and psychedelics not to on them we spent very little time on those we could probably discuss that further but perception is not necessarily the same as subjective in terms of cognitive function and I for the other ones you irritated people with um but we covered many of them so lastly really fast because you covered a lot of areas I tried to do my best to to ask kind of the quick questions along the way but I surely missed plenty um so question number one is if somebody has questions for you on these things what&amp;#39;s the best way that they can learn more from you can they contact you directly how does this work the best place is probably uh so I have a podcast the best of BR and fitness podcast uh Josh Turk a neurologist is is my co-host neuroscientist and a neurologist working together so and then we can cover at it from those relative uh points and so if it&amp;#39;s more clinical he&amp;#39;ll cover it if it&amp;#39;s more you know basic science or statistical or something then I&amp;#39;ll come for I I&amp;#39;ll cover it that&amp;#39;s a weekly show or every other week something like that yeah YouTube and all the normal places all the normal places and uh so you can uh it&amp;#39;s a question and answer Style Show so you submit a question and then we&amp;#39;ll answer it one question every episode um and so that&amp;#39;s nice because if you have a question somebody else probably has that same question and then other people can um can benefit from it um and then uh equally you can my Instagram Dr Tommy wood uh you can you can DM me but I might direct you towards the podcast because then don&amp;#39;t DM him just go to the podcast first um but you also have your substack as well yeah which is a I love this format by the way yeah so um it&amp;#39;s free it&amp;#39;s free free substack uh best be Fitness substack when you sign up when you put in your email uh you get emailed a PDF which covers all the nutrients and blood tests that we would recommend just like basics for for people who worried about um long-term cognitive function so all the stuff we talked about today but they can get that direct PDF to them that&amp;#39;ll be emailed directly to you and then like every time like we have a news article or a podcast or whatever that that comes to the substack okay and there is an option to pay there they don&amp;#39;t have to though but if they do pay then they can get access to additional questions 101 like is that how it works yeah so we have um there is a an OP you can always opt to pay for substack although you don&amp;#39;t like all of our content is free but if you do pay then we do um we&amp;#39;ve just started doing some amas so you can join us on a zoom call and just ask us where you want literally live in person live in person wow craziness yeah I don&amp;#39;t know how you do that you&amp;#39;re wild man um and if they want to come visit your lab at the University of Washington and get their brain tested is that uh is that an option yeah uh TBD TBD coming soon little spoiler friends there so none yet okay um you&amp;#39;ve been in incredibly gracious with your time and expertise man really appreciate it&amp;#39;s always fun hanging out uh bummer we didn&amp;#39;t get to lift weights this time but perhaps perhaps next time the last thing I want to ask you here and I&amp;#39;m putting you on the spot all right if you got anointed to the Maha board the make America healthy again and you said Dr Tommy wood you are an MD you&amp;#39;re a PhD from Oxford and Cambridge and now the University of Washington what would be your first most important biggest charge you would say this is what I want to get done to make America&amp;#39;s brains I don&amp;#39;t know if healthier again is the right word but we&amp;#39;ll just say make them healthier um I think just because it&amp;#39;s it it would be two-pronged one is educate people to know that you can slow and prevent cognitive decline and improve cognitive function right because in order to change that you need to know it&amp;#39;s possible and most people don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s possible and then I would focus on the importance of cognitive stimulus and the reason for that is other aspects supposedly of what&amp;#39;s going to happen in that movement are going to address metabolic health and other things that we know are important but the idea that cognitive function is driven by cognitive stimulus is still sort of underappreciated so that would be that would be my uh my primary directive and as part of that that I might dramatically decrease funding for Mouse studies and Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease because I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s gone us anywhere H interesting and this is from someone who does animal research in your life I do that for my job yeah and a lot of what we do does not relate to humans at all or doesn&amp;#39;t end up relating to humans at all yeah ends up as a failure so well I can assure you my friend when your name comes up on that ballot I will tick that box and vote for Dr Wood on the thing so thank you so much man appreciate you being here thank you so much for having me this has been really great I hope you enjoyed
