so there&amp;#39;s a lot of things you can do to alter resting metabolic rate basil metabolic rate I can&amp;#39;t cover them all but I pulled out eight very specific ones that I thought you would be most interested in they have the most research behind them those the easiest to integrate and they are the least kooky is how I&amp;#39;ll say it the other final caveat here is remember just because we acutely change your resting metabolic rate that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean we&amp;#39;re going to lose body fat in the long term we&amp;#39;ll Circle back to that later but the first of our eight is what are called spicy foods people this is in the lore people talk about it a lot it&amp;#39;s out there a bunch is it really real yes technically it&amp;#39;s true although if you wanted to consider this to be a myth I wouldn&amp;#39;t push back that hard this is how the field honestly Works in a lot of the cases it&amp;#39;s officially there but is it practically relevant I&amp;#39;ll just share with you the data and I&amp;#39;ll let you side now I&amp;#39;ll tell you my personal bias I love spicy foods I put hot sauce or some sort of spice on basically everything I eat I love it uh I actually did I grew up not eating anything spicy probably even into my mid 20s black pepper was too spicy for me I my family just growing up never did anything like that but I learned to love spicy food when I started dieting I started cutting weight and losing weight for competitions and Combat Sports and weightlifting and things like that part of that I&amp;#39;d never done it and I&amp;#39;m bringing this up now because I realized man spicy food really helped me in that caloric Management number one when things are really spicy I at least personally tend to not eat as much so I&amp;#39;m not going to Gorge as much because I&amp;#39;m dealing with sort of a little bit of the pain and suffering I&amp;#39;m more likely to stop a little bit early I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s really well documented scientifically but it&amp;#39;s certainly personally true for me additionally spices herbs flavors help you make food not taste as Bland when you&amp;#39;re really controlling stuff so often times when you&amp;#39;re managing calories you&amp;#39;re probably not putting on uh flavor facts you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re managing fat so you don&amp;#39;t have the cheeses and the sauces and so because of that food can start to taste a little bit Bland the beauty of spices and hot sauces is they can be a caloric and so you can make food taste different and you can change it up and have more variety when your total actual food intake is not that different day by day so from a practical perspective the work we&amp;#39;ve done with people that are trying to lose weight and me personally I love spicy foods I used them a ton here just think about exchanging out hot sauce or Tabasco for ketchup right easy win there ketchup has a reasonable amount of calories you can get tons of different hot sauces that don&amp;#39;t have any and there you go you&amp;#39;ve Sav that 50 calories or 100 calories per serving which adds up a ton so from a practical perspective I like it if you don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s cool too does it do anything scientifically yes it actually does if you eat spicy foods and most of the research here has been done on things like Chili Peppers ginger red peppers and even turmeric these will increase your resting metabolic rates they&amp;#39;ll increase your thermal effective food and they&amp;#39;ll actually oftentimes lower energy intake like I mentioned earlier we&amp;#39;ve seen that routinely there&amp;#39;s actually been research on other spicy foods that wasn&amp;#39;t as promising uh I know that things people have looked at mustard horseradish black Peppers those don&amp;#39;t seem to do anything but the other ones I mentioned a second ago do seem to do that and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re effectively working by giving you a shot of adrenaline so more specifically they&amp;#39;re increasing and activating bet beta adrenergic responses that&amp;#39;s the long way of saying adrenaline or epinephrine and getting sympathetic Drive you&amp;#39;ll see this like pretty routinely and you don&amp;#39;t have to stretch your imag too far to think yeah eat something super spicy and you get a little shot of adrenaline all right now at the same time this this is a classic Lane Norton right he Dr Norton a friend of mine always talks about people majoring in the minors and this is a good example of that so technically does it increase metabolic rate yes does it do it to a level that you really care not really sure what you&amp;#39;re functionally talking about here is probably three to five calories so officially it does doesn&amp;#39;t matter I don&amp;#39;t know um you have you would have to eat a enormous amount of red bell peppers you would have to probably eat ounces or pounds of Ginger or turmeric for this to have a real practical output on you so Additionally you get sensitized or desensitized to these things so you may not have the same response over time I certainly know if you would have given me Tabasco 20 years ago I would have had a much bigger adrenaline response than I do now and so since we know that&amp;#39;s the mechanism is it then still leading to additional increases in my resting metabolic rate I actually don&amp;#39;t think it does I would assume me personally probably nothing uh because I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m so used to it by now so when you balance the like technically officially I could pull up a a systematic review or a paper and show that it increases metabolic rate if someone doesn&amp;#39;t like it or it&amp;#39;s not a preference or they&amp;#39;re traveling like should you really be going out of your way to strongly encourage spicy foods for people to boost metabolism I don&amp;#39;t think so right probably not the biggest win so while I technically have this on our list again if you said this is on your list of things that don&amp;#39;t work I wouldn&amp;#39;t push back that much either moving on then the second on our list is actually surprising enough water intake there is more than a small amount of research on water increasing metabolic activity if you think about this for a couple of seconds it makes perfect sense I actually know one paper specifically looked at I think like 16 or 17 ounces of water and found that it increased resting metabolic rate by 10 to 30% for about an hour now practically I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend chugging water all day optim hydrate but think about what it does if you&amp;#39;re ingesting something at a temperature that is lower than the temperature inside your stomach by putting that in there you&amp;#39;ll have to burn calories to heat that water up in fact that is actually by the way the strict definition of a calorie it&amp;#39;s the exact amount of energy it takes to raise I think it&amp;#39;s one gram of water one degree something like it&amp;#39;s pretty close like the definition of a calorie is how much energy it takes to increase the temperature of water so by definition if your body is working to increase the temperature of your water then is going to be burning some calories now there&amp;#39;s also some and I wouldn&amp;#39;t call this extensive but some research on then by extension of logic colder water might be of more benefit than room temperature water it should theoretically take more energy to heat up okay but probably the bigger benefit here if there is one at all is satiety so I know of again another study off the top of my head here that in overweight individuals and that gave them um I think something like a half liter of water which is a reasonable amount to drink 30 minutes before meal and those that group eventually lost more weight and so what you&amp;#39;re probably looking at here is a lot of people I I&amp;#39;ve heard in the vernacular say things like oh a lot of times when you think you&amp;#39;re hungry you&amp;#39;re just thirsty I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s necessarily true or not but having dealt with a lot of folks who have to lose weight over time again athletes and regular people I will say in my personal coaching experience making sure you&amp;#39;re drinking water will help you reduce calorie intake the amount of food you eat in a meal and so forth with really no consequences to digestibility unless you&amp;#39;re you know going extreme with it so water is another potential option you can turn to the effect will be minimal but you start stacking some things on top of each other and you need to drink water anyway so not something I would say to overdo but just making sure you&amp;#39;re not under hydrated is probably the biggest win here a similar concept here but probably more effective is using a different form of temperature regulation that is the temperature in the environment you&amp;#39;re in so there have been several studies that have looked at lowering the thermostat in your house by even a few degrees and that can lead to substantial and significant loss of body fat over time same exact concept here if your body has to work a little bit harder to keep itself at a certain temperature that is caloric expenditure you&amp;#39;ve boosted your metabolism and it will result in a practical and meaningful loss of body fat now I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily Advocate dropping the thermostat so much that you&amp;#39;re freezing and your fingers are frozen you can&amp;#39;t type and work but maybe a notch or two I have friends that have done this a lot over the years where they bring it down one degree for three months bring it down another degree bring it down another degree and just slowly work themselves down 3 or 4 degrees where they used to keep their house at 72Â° and now they keep it at 66 or something reasonable like that if this feels like majoring in the minors to you fine again my position here was just to share with you all the data that we know of let you know how much it works how well it works and then you can decide what to deploy what to disregard or not based on your situation and circumstances all right so playing with temperature whether it is colder water or colder environment is another option and probably more effective than the spicy food thing but still we haven&amp;#39;t I probably haven&amp;#39;t sold you a ton on things that are really going to move the needle but we&amp;#39;re going to change that here soon fourth on our list is something I&amp;#39;ve talked about now and that is caffeine there is a lot of data on this I will summarize the entire field but you can generally expect something between like a 3 to 11% increase in resting metabolic rate that&amp;#39;s going to last somewhere between an hour to three hours this is very very well documented pretty easy it&amp;#39;s a stimulant it&amp;#39;s going to rev up energy it&amp;#39;s G to tell your body to expect energy output so it&amp;#39;s going to get you going nicotine is next on my list and it has a very similar effect the magnitude of effect is a little bit smaller generally more like five to six% increase and resting metabolic rate and it&amp;#39;s going to last for the same you know 60 Minutes 120 Minutes something like that now I personally don&amp;#39;t use nicotine we&amp;#39;ve used it and some clients they&amp;#39;ve asked for it and we&amp;#39;ve done it with some success there I personally like to avoid it as much as I can but those data are there and and use it how you will similar and now we&amp;#39;re up to number six on the list is green tea or green tea extract you&amp;#39;ll see this abbreviate a lot of GTE has similar effect of caffeine but in the four to 5% range for about the same length and duration as we&amp;#39;ve mentioned for some of the stuff prior with water and spicy foods one thing that has been documented pretty consist ly with caffeine nicotine and green tea is they all also affect satiety so they&amp;#39;re appetite suppressant so is the benefit really in the elevation and resting metabolic rate I don&amp;#39;t know maybe yes maybe no but if it helps you just not feel as hungry and not then overeat that&amp;#39;s probably the real win but options nonetheless a lot of people are already consuming these things I don&amp;#39;t think you need to go in there and add additional stimulus to your life if you&amp;#39;re already on them you don&amp;#39;t have to use these at all but one more time they are options to use or not at your discretion number seven on our list is a combo I had to do it this way if not the list would have been 50 things or more and I&amp;#39;m generally going to call these Thermo Regulators so this is a handful of herbs and drugs and other stimulant like factors that are going to have a similar impact as caffeine and green tea and so on and so forth but they&amp;#39;re not in those forms just to give you a couple of examples wonderful scientist Bill Campbell friend of mine in Florida has done some work in the past on Guana uh you can Google that one up there g a r a an a um combined with other elements much of the research in this field and the reason I&amp;#39;m calling them you know Thermo Regulators is because they&amp;#39;re rarely single ingredient things so they&amp;#39;re multiple herbs combined with multiple different things and combinations and Cocktails and so you don&amp;#39;t know what the individual effect is but nonetheless in these multi-ingredient Thermo Regulators in in Bill study in particular I I think they gave their I think he did it in young healthy men probably the college kids that are running around his lab and they saw about a 10% increase in resting metabolic rate for about three hours post exercise now what I liked about Bill study in particular of course because he&amp;#39;s such an awesome scientist is they had a placebo group and they reported the placebo group what I mean by that is the placebo group had a 3% increase in resting metabolic rate so if you actually kind of cancel that out you could still see about a 7% bump in RMR here which I think their data was something like it took them from about a group average of 8 or 1,850 calories to 2,000 So 150k Cal bump from this Guana based multi-ingredient supplements tons of other Studies have been done like this one in particular I know actually several of them have used things like caffeine plus GTE plus herbl and stuff like that and if you go back to the numbers I just gave you on green tea and caffeine combine them with other ingredients you&amp;#39;ll see about a 10% total increase again going to last two to three hours others have been done on caffeine GTE and niin combined with actually uh something called Garcinia Cambogia which was the original primary ingredient and hydroxy cut you&amp;#39;ve probably seen hydroxy cuts and commercials all over the place I think there was actually a bunch of problems with people with getting liver failure so they took this ingredient out of it um so it&amp;#39;s no longer in there to my understanding but it was in the original formulation but nonetheless you throw all those things together and you might see a 15% or greater increase in RMR last one here similar caffeine plus GTE plus yiman another one showed about a 15% bump so you can basically see here kind of no matter what combination you have of these stimulants and herbs about the higher end of the impact is a 15 or so percent increase for about 2 to three hours right whether that fits in what you like and and how you live your life that&amp;#39;s up to you I personally don&amp;#39;t use any of these for fat loss clients it&amp;#39;s not how we approach it but if you want to there&amp;#39;s the data make your choice next up fish oil now this is a really interesting one we know of the many benefits of fish oil but many don&amp;#39;t realize the metabolic ones easy study here to highlight what&amp;#39;s going on 24 females and they did this in I think they were over 60 656 years old uh if I&amp;#39;m remembering exactly the age range there and they gave him three grams per day of EPA and DHA for a total of 12 weeks now what&amp;#39;s cool about this study is they actually matched it with olive oil and so calories were equated for one group get out the olive oil which is obviously a very healthy food Choice the other one specifically got fish oil and so really in smart study design here because they of course matched calories they matched fat and they gave them not really crummy food items or low quality stuff but two high quality items and so what that allowed them to do is tease out the Direct effects of the EPA and DHA net result here and remember this is chronic so what happened not in the the 60 minutes or 90 minutes or 3 hours post taking the fish oil what happened at rest 12 weeks later about a 15% increase in uh 14 actually I think increase in resting metabolic rate they saw an increase in energy expenditure during exercise by about 10% and the fat oxidation rate both at rest and exercise were increased about 19 and 27% respectively what&amp;#39;s probably more impressive than all that though is they saw a increase in lean mass by about 4% take a second to digest that by simply taking three grams per day of fish oil not a high dose at all you saw a chronic elevation in resting metabolic rate that at a functional and practical outcome of a 4% in lean mass compared to olive oil now what do you think this would be compared to of a lower quality fat or Worse food choice in general it would probably be substantially more so to me this is incredibly impressive and it is another reason why taking fish oil is probably a really smart strategy but in full honesty here and candidly I didn&amp;#39;t know this I had missed this one I was pretty aware of basically everything we talked about so far at this point but I had absolutely no idea that fish oil would chronically do this at rest over time so pretty powerful uh pretty low hanging fruit and a pretty easy win in my opinion if you enjoyed this clip you can watch the full episode by clicking here
