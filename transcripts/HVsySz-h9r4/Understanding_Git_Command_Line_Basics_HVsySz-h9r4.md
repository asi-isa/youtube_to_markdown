# Understanding Git Command Line Basics

In this blog post, we'll cover the basics of using Git command line. We'll start with a brief introduction of what Git is, then walk you through how to get Git installed. Finally, we'll delve into the basic commands for working with local and remote repositories. We'll be referencing a couple of images taken from the Pro Git book, which is a great resource for learning about Git. 

## Who is this Blog Post For?

This blog post is beneficial for:

- **Beginners**: Those who've never used Version Control before. Git is the most widely used Version Control System and this is a great place to start.
- **Version Control Users**: Those who've used Version Control Systems, but not Git. If you're transitioning from a system like SVN, then you'll find this post useful.
- **GUI Git Users**: Those who've used Git, but mainly through GUI visual tools. It's better to learn these command line tools from the beginning, as GUI tools can only do so much.

## Understanding Git

Git is a distributed version control system. This is different from a central version control system like SVN. In a central system, everything is located in one place and people check out from and check back into this central location. This can be problematic when access to the central server or repository is lost or interrupted. 

A distributed Version Control System like Git allows everyone to have a local repository with all the information that the remote repository has, based on the last time that they synced. This means you can view every single change that's been made to the repository since it was created, even without access to the remote repository. It's like every developer has an entire backup of the repository.

## Getting Started with Git

### Installing Git

To install Git, visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com), go to the downloads tab, and find the download for your operating system. The installation process is pretty straightforward.

### Setting Up Git 

Once Git is installed, you can check the version to confirm successful installation by running the command:

```bash
git --version
```

You also need to set up some Global configuration variables. These variables are important to identify who is making changes to the code. To add these variables, use the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email Address"
```

To check these values, you can run:

```bash
git config --list
```

You should see your user.name and user.email values listed.

## Using Git

There are two common scenarios when starting to use Git:

1. **Local Project**: You have an existing project on your local machine that you want to start tracking.
2. **Remote Project**: You want to start developing on an existing project remotely.

### Tracking a Local Project

To start tracking a local code base with Git, navigate to the directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This command initializes an empty Git repository in your directory. Now, you are ready to start making commits to your repository. 

### Tracking a Remote Project

To start tracking an existing remote project, the command is `git clone`. This command will clone the remote repository and start tracking it. The syntax is as follows:

```bash
git clone <url> <where-to-clone>
```

## Committing Changes

When using Git, there are three states to be aware of:

1. **Working Directory**: Untracked and modified files are in our working directory.
2. **Staging Area**: This is where we organize what we want to be committed to our repository.
3. **Committed Files**: The final stage where changes are permanently stored in our git directory.

When you've made changes to your code and are ready to commit, first add the changes to the staging area using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add -A
```

Then, commit these changes using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Conclusion

Git is a powerful tool for version control and it's essential for modern software development. This guide covered the basics of Git, including how to install Git, set up your user identity, and work with local and remote repositories. 

There's still a lot to learn about Git, including how to handle merge conflicts, undo mistakes, tag versions, and more advanced topics such as rebasing and cherry-picking. Stay tuned for future posts on these topics. 

Remember, mastering Git takes time and practice, so don't be discouraged if you don't understand everything right away. Happy coding!
