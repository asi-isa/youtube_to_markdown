There are several studies that show that late-life
cognitive engagement or stimulus, and they&amp;#39;ve measured it
with like how often you go, like you read books and go to museums and all these kinds of things, or they&amp;#39;ve done it through like how cognitively
stimulating is your work. That then also slows, or is associated with a
slower rate of decline, and also a slower or a
lower risk of dementia. So there was one study
they actually included. They sort of stole the forest plot from it and they included it in the
Lancet Commission report. They had early life education and then they had how cognitively
stimulating your job was. And what they saw was that people who had
more early-life education and but not a stimulating job
and cognitive stimulating job, and people who had less
early-life education but a cognitive stimulating
job later in life, they had about the same risk of dementia. So you can offset a lower
education early in life with more cognitive
stimulation later in life. The lowest risk was
obviously those who had both.
